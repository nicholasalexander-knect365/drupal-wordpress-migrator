Many business leaders realize that the right operational risk management (ORM) system helps to lower operating and auditing costs, reduce operating loss, increase customer and staff satisfaction, optimize insurance coverage and premiums, and promote compliance with regulatory requirements. Also, the operational discipline cultivated as part of an effective ORM system allows leaders to maintain consistency and reliability while maximizing efficiencies throughout their manufacturing and production processes.</p><p>But recognizing the importance of risk management doesn&#8217;t always translate to having an effective strategy or system in place. Adopting a strategic approach to ORM can ensure the optimization of resources while maximizing risk reduction. Not all ORM strategies are the same, nor should they be. Organizations must develop a strategy that complements their business model and operations. This requires a solid understanding of the specific risks they face, as well as the people they employ, and then fully integrating the system into the company&#8217;s day-to-day operations.</p><h2>Risk Is Not Universally Defined</h2><p><strong><img src="http://iot-institute.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/measure-of-risk-industryweek.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Finding the sweet spot for operational risk. © 2016 DuPont" width="770" /></strong></p><p><strong>Figure 1: Finding the sweet spot for operational risk. © 2016 DuPont</strong></p><p>Risk is assessed by evaluating the potential for incidents along with the degree of impact they could have on an organization should they occur. That means enterprises face a wide spectrum of potential risks, ranging from high frequency/low severity risks to low frequency/high severity risks, and everything in between. The range of risks may vary between one company and another depending upon several factors, such as physical location, prevailing culture, competency and operating discipline. Given the wide range of potential risks and a limit on the resources that a company can devote to risk management, it makes sense to adopt a strategy that assigns appropriate effort to potential risks. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to mitigating the risks a company faces, and it is simply not practical to address all risks with the same level of intensity.</p><p>Companies have had success adopting what DuPont Sustainable Solutions (DSS) refers to as a &#8220;differentiated risk&#8221; approach. This strategy ensures that appropriate effort and resources are expended based on the specific risk profile of the industry and business in which a company operates. This results not only in optimal risk management for an organization, but also ensuring value for the investment, giving companies a competitive advantage in their business sector (see Figure 1). Successful ORM lies in identifying, evaluating and controlling losses and differentially managing associated risks.</p><h2>Understanding the Human Element to Risk</h2><p>Despite the well-intentioned efforts around risk management systems and organizational work processes, incidents can still happen. That&#8217;s because people design, operate and maintain an organization&#8217;s assets, fleets, and equipment -- and people aren&#8217;t perfect. DuPont&#8217;s research shows that 82% of incidents within the workplace can be attributed to poor decision-making. One way to reduce incidents is to understand what influences employees&#8217; decision making.</p><p>Companies can enhance safety performance in particular by understanding the behavioral characteristics of their workers. Employees make decisions based on what they think and feel. There is also a social context that factors into decision making, which includes the social norms and unwritten rules that influence an individual&#8217;s or team&#8217;s behavior. Understanding mindsets and behaviors can help companies create a performance culture that can achieve superior results. Often, the impact these behavioral contexts has on outcomes is significantly undervalued.</p><h2>Integration is Essential</h2><p>When managing operational risks, it is tempting to assign only technical solutions to problems or risks that arise. However, an exclusive focus on worker and process safety elements is inadequate. And while companies that actually consider behavioral impacts on incidents and focus on managing and reducing risk rather than simply driving compliance to systems or procedures are the most effective, neither technical solutions nor behavioral solutions alone are sufficient to fully address operational risks.</p><p><strong><img src="http://iot-institute.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/integrated-approach-manage-risk-industryweek.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Integrated Approach to Managing Operational Risk. © 2016 DuPont" width="770" /></strong></p><p><strong>Figure 2: Integrated Approach to Managing Operational Risk. © 2016 DuPont<strong> </strong></strong></p><p>What is optimal is an integrated approach (see Figure 2) that addresses all the elements of a successful ORM system:</p><ul><li><strong>Managing Processes</strong> defines the vision, sets the strategy and tactics, translates this into key performance indicators at all levels of the organization, monitors performance and sets up the organizational structure to support the processes.</li><li>A sound <strong>Technical Model</strong> defines hazards and losses, assesses the associated risks and provides standards and procedures for mitigating risk.</li><li><strong>Capabilities Engine</strong> seeks to educate and provide employees, not only with the technical knowledge, but also with the ideal values, attitudes and beliefs that will engage and motivate them. It requires clearly communicating expectations and accountability, and encouraging teamwork and collaboration.</li><li><strong>Mindsets & Behaviors</strong> ensure a company&#8217;s commitment to reducing risk is driven and reinforced by active participation of corporate leadership through coaching, motivation and ownership of results. Leaders must understand how individual employees behave, think and feel, and how that drives their decisions. This leadership style is cascaded from executive leadership to the critical level of first-line leadership. Tapping into the entire organization&#8217;s motivation and problem-solving capabilities results in an approach supported throughout the company.</li></ul><p>This integrated approach allows companies to protect their people, their assets and ultimately, their bottom line.</p><h2>The Goal &#8211; Cultural Maturity</h2><p>For an organization to perform at the highest levels in the context of risk management, each and every employee, from the C-suite to the shift worker, must possess a commitment to operations that go beyond merely reacting to incidents to actively preventing them. Achieving this cultural maturity is the true measure of the strength and effectiveness of a company&#8217;s integrated management system.</p><p>When DuPont experienced a plateau in corporate safety performance in the early 1990s, then-Chairman and CEO Ed Woolard commissioned a study that found the maturity of the safety culture at DuPont had a direct impact on safety performance (as measured by total recordable injuries). This relationship came to be illustrated in the DuPont Bradley Value Curve&#8482;.</p><p><img src="http://iot-institute.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/dupont-bradley-value-curve-industryweek.jpg" alt="Figure 3: DuPont Bradley Value Curve&#8482;. © 2016 DuPont" width="770" /></p><p><strong>Figure 3: DuPont Bradley Value Curve&#8482;. © 2016 DuPont </strong></p><p><br />In the last two years, our experience with clients has shown that companies that have evolved toward a more mature risk culture of interdependence reap the dual benefits of reduced incidents and improved productivity. They are able to mitigate risks while maximizing opportunities for sustainable value creation. They also are able to allocate appropriate time, attention and resources to deliver improved performance.</p><p> Based on these findings, we&#8217;ve developed the DuPont Bradley Value Curve&#8482; that adds the Dimension of operational excellence and provides a more holistic picture of the impact cultural maturity can have on productivity (see Figure 3).</p><h2>Seven Steps to a Successful Operational Risk Management Program</h2><p>Today, companies that want to deploy an effective ORM program face a number of headwinds. In recent years, rapid shifts have occurred in the operational landscape of many organizations, particularly those in the industrial sector. Companies are now more global than ever with larger and more complex supply chains. They need to manage an expanding list of regulatory requirements, and the explosion in social media means their activities are scrutinized more closely than ever before.</p><p>Most notably, it is increasingly difficult in today&#8217;s environment for organizations to secure adequate funding necessary to ensure their ORM strategy continues as an ongoing program. Research recently conducted for DSS by independent consulting firm Verdantix found roughly two out of every three organizations (65%) claimed lack of available budget was a significant barrier to securing funding for ORM programs.</p><p>Based on this research, in which 75 senior leaders across eight industry sectors spanning 10 countries were interviewed to determine their perceptions of ORM strategies within their organizations, DSS recommends seven steps companies should follow to implement a successful ORM program:</p><ol><li><strong>Secure approval and leadership at the corporate level.</strong> This is a critical first step. An ORM program will only be truly effective if it is championed at the very top of the organization. Roughly eight out of 10 companies (79%) say that accountability for risk management is assigned at the corporate level, according to the research conducted for DSS.</li><li><strong>Introduce risk accountability across the organization.</strong> Employees across every level of the enterprise need to be trained to incorporate risk-based thinking into their day-to-day activities and be held accountable for risks within their immediate area of control. Alarmingly, more than one-third (38%) of companies say that shop-floor employees are currently not held accountable for risk management.</li><li><strong>Agree to timely risk assessments.</strong> Risk assessments help ensure companies comply with new requirements and keep risk management a top priority. The frequency of these audits should be determined by the unique characteristics of each company and its operational footprint. According to the research done for DSS, 92% of firms are conducting risk assessments on at least an annual basis. Reviewing and revising an organizations&#8217; risk assessment on a regular basis allows the company to keep the risk profile up-to-date and to incorporate any relevant changes (economic, geopolitical, technology, workforce).</li><li><strong>Quantify and prioritize risks.</strong> Managing an optimized ORM program requires that risks are quantified in terms of probability and severity, and calculated in terms of the costs and benefits of mitigating a risk versus allowing the risk to remain as is. This enables mitigation efforts to be targeted most effectively.</li><li><strong>Establish appropriate metrics and key performance indicators to monitor and assess performance.</strong> This is one of the most important steps in a successful ORM program. It enables companies to ensure the appropriate effort and resources are expended based on the specific risk profile of the business. The research conducted for DSS shows a number of firms are already aware of the importance of this step and are supplementing the development of their metrics with advice from outside sources.</li><li><strong>Implement consistent, well-documented and cost-effective controls. </strong>Such control measures are necessary to actively mitigate identified priority risks. While nearly all companies (98%) feel they already have adequate controls already in place, only about one in four (27%) considered them cost-effective, suggesting an opportunity for them to identify better options for managing and controlling identified risks.</li><li><strong>Reinforce the importance of risk management through regular communications.</strong> Establishing a regular timetable of communication on ORM performance is an effective way of maintaining engagement on the subject. Communications should be tailored to specific levels and functions of the organization to address different priorities and focus areas.</li></ol><p>Developing effective ORM programs to successfully mitigate risk should be a priority in today&#8217;s competitive business environment. It requires that companies not only structure a program that is unique to their business operations and engrained into the day-to-day activities of every employee at every level of the organization, but also that enterprises make an ongoing commitment to ORM despite the many challenges they currently face. Companies that adopt a long-term view and take the necessary steps to implement ongoing ORM programs today will reap the benefits of a safer and more successful organization in the future.</p><p><em> Article was originally published on <a href="http://www.industryweek.com/">Industry Week</a></em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

But we wondered, are there specific legal entanglements that an end user can get into because of a security breach? For advice, we asked Creighton Magid. He is a lawyer with the international law firm Dorsey & Whitney who works with clients to reduce their liability risk and navigate the Federal regulatory system.</p><p><strong>What exactly are people worried about when it comes to security and the Internet of Things?</strong></p><p>There has been a level of concern over data theft and hackers getting access to personally identifiable information. </p><p>The newer arrival on the scene for everyone--cities, manufacturers and utilities--is the potential threat to their basic infrastructure and processes. The interaction of the online world with their physical operating systems raises the risk for organizations that their operations could be brought to a halt and their equipment destroyed or taken offline for a period of time. </p><p><strong>Your clients include municipalities, manufacturers, and product developers. Is there a common thread among them in how they approach cybersecurity in their organizations? </strong></p><p>By and large, I don&#8217;t think that there is a full understanding of the magnitude of the potential threat. But there&#8217;s a good reason for that: A lot of the emphasis has been on data breaches, with less of a focus put on securing systems and their interconnections with the physical world than there should be. </p><p>Estimates put the number of connected devices added to the ecosystem at 5.5 million every day, and that&#8217;s a lot more potential points of entry for a cybersecurity attack. So there may be vulnerabilities that organizations have not thought of, or their systems may have become vulnerable to new threats for which an upgrade or security patch has not been issued.</p><p><strong>Any examples?  </strong></p><p>Well there are plenty! In a well-publicized case, Ukraine&#8217;s power grid was shut down to the substation level. The only reason the country was saved from being plunged into darkness was&#8212;ironically--because of the aged infrastructure, so they were able to intervene manually. </p><p><strong>But, hey, why worry? Doesn&#8217;t my cyber insurance cover any damages or loss of revenue due to a security breach?</strong></p><p>Some cyber policies include exclusions that basically say that if you do not meet minimum levels of cyber protection, your claims could be denied. I am aware of one case where the insurer argued that the policyholder had not engaged in minimum levels of cyber protection and diligence and should be denied coverage. In an ironic twist, the case was ultimately dismissed because the insurer didn&#8217;t follow the dispute resolution procedures in its own policy, not because of the merits of the case.</p><p><strong>Why then, if I am an end user, can&#8217;t I just sue the guy who sold me the equipment? </strong></p><p>The answer here lies at the intersection of product liability law and contract law.  For example, an automation supplier is likely to have damages limitations in its contract with the end user. For consequential damages, the supplier would argue that the plant&#8217;s remedies were limited to the amount of the contract or something of that nature. But if you are the plant, you might agree that the contractual limitations applied to the automation equipment as delivered, but sue on a theory that there was a lack of post -market vigilance on the part of the automation supplier to make you aware of new and emerging threats and to issue upgrades or patches.</p><p>This issue of post-delivery obligations regarding security has not yet been tested in courts. But I can see that happening in a world in which threats emerge daily and in which there is an expectation that security patches and upgrades are going to be delivered.</p><p><strong>On the flip side, should organizations worry that they will get sued?</strong></p><p>In general, yes.  The plaintiff&#8217;s bar has shown considerable interest in pursuing internet-of-things cases.  The Federal Trade Commission has been very active in pursuing consumer product companies that represent their systems as being secure or that imply that their systems secure when they are not. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit last year upheld the FTC&#8217;s authority to regulate in the cyber arena under the agency&#8217;s authority to address unfair marketing practices.</p><p>In that case, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts initially fought but later agreed to settle FTC charges that its security practices exposed payment card information to hackers in three data breaches. Under the terms of the settlement, the company will establish a comprehensive information security program to protect cardholder data and will conduct annual security audits.</p><p><em>Article was originally published on <a title="Here&apos;s a Security Worry: Legal Entanglements" href="http://www.industryweek.com/systems-integration/heres-security-worry-legal-entanglements" target="_blank">Industry Week</a>.</em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

An estimated 7 to 10 million people have the disease worldwide, according to the <a href="http://www.pdf.org/en/parkinson_statistics">Parkinson&apos;s Disease Foundation</a>, for which there is presently no cure.</p><p>Ali had partnered with the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) to help find a cure for the condition. Ali &#8220;was really committed to finding an answer to this disease, as he was to finding answers to strife in the world and wars and conflict and all kinds of things,&#8221; remembered Michael J. Fox in an interview with <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/michael-fox-reflects-friendship-muhammad-ali/story?id=39613224">ABC News</a>. After publicly announcing that he had the disease, Fox received a phone call the legendary boxer. &#8220;He didn&apos;t say much. He just said: &#8216;With you in this fight, we can win,&#8217;&#8221; Fox recalls. &#8220;I cried.&#8221;</p><p><strong>A Quest for a Cure Based on Wearables, the Cloud, and Big Data</strong></p><p>Curing Parkinson&#8217;s is one of the principal aims of the MJFF. One of the chief challenges is that the disease itself is not well understood. The precise cause of the disease remains uncertain although researchers have identified a number of risk factors for the disease, including genetics and environmental triggers.</p><p>In 2014, the MJFF, Intel, and Cloudera <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/publication-detail.html?id=555&category=7">announced the Fox Insight</a> study that uses Big Data to analyze the progression of the illness in an online clinical study. Participants are given a Pebble smartwatch to help monitor tremor symptoms and sleep patterns on a daily basis. The patients&#8217; smartphones captures the data and beams it to the cloud.</p><p>The ultimate hope is that Big Data analytics technology will be able to cull meaningful conclusions by tracking large volumes of patient data. Researchers, for instance, could monitor how well certain drugs&#8212;or drug cocktails&#8212;fare in controlling Parkinson&#8217;s symptoms like tremor.</p><p>The project marks a paradigm shift in how the progression of the disease was monitored in traditional doctor&#8217;s visits. &#8220;Nearly 200 years after Parkinson&#8217;s disease was first described by Dr. James Parkinson in 1817, we are still subjectively measuring Parkinson&#8217;s disease largely the same way doctors did then,&#8221; explained Todd Sherer, Ph.D., CEO of The Michael J. Fox Foundation when unveiling the study in 2014.</p><p>Traditionally, doctors monitoring the progression of the disease have primarily been based on subjective data: During office visits every three months or so, patients would report their symptoms and doctors would ask them to perform several activities, which would then be subjectively ranked by the physicians. For instance, a doctor would instruct Parkinson&#8217;s patients to, say, touch their nose and then rate how well they could perform that action on a numeric scale. Typically, the disease is monitored based on criteria set by the Unified Parkinson&apos;s disease rating scale, which also considers factors such as speech, mood and behavior, and self-evaluation from the patient.</p><p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges is that the data came from small samples, the data is very infrequent, and the data was very subjective,&#8221; says Vijay Raja, Senior Solutions Manager at Cloudera. Doctors would typically see a patient a handful of times per year, and track the progression of the disease using relatively few data points. Meanwhile, the symptoms of the disease are constantly changing, meaning that much of the nuances of how the disease evolves have been lost. &#8220;Fast forward to today, and Intel, Cloudera, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation can track up to 300 data points per second,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You are talking about a GB of data per patient per day. If you multiply that by 10,000 people, you have an enormous sample size of patients. You are going to have data equivalent to the Library of Congress.&#8221; The Michael J. Fox Foundation calls it the &#8220;world&#8217;s largest collection of data about life with Parkinson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><p>In the study, participants are given an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; wrist-worn smartwatch with an accelerometer. Software co-developed between the Michael J. Fox Foundation and Intel can distinguish between tremors and can determine whether a patient&#8217;s movements. The watch and app track activity levels, sleep, tremor, and medication management. The app, known as the Fox Insight Mobile, also offers study participants a dashboard of their activity levels and can remind them to take medicine. It also coordinates the transmission of data to the cloud.</p><p>Patients can also enter information related to their daily experience into a Web portal. All of the information from those three channels is sent to the cloud, enabling researchers to study data from all three sources. The system allows hundreds of concurrent users to analyze the data and perform near real-time analytics.</p><p>Intel developed a big data analytics platform for the project. The platform integrates a number of software components including Cloudera CDH &#8212;a secure data platform that collects, stores, and manages data of any type and volume.</p><p>Intel also created algorithms to help track activity levels and also to detect tremors using a frequency analysis in the 4&#8211;12 Hz range. It was challenging to create a system that could distinguish between tremors and motion caused by activities such as driving over a pothole or brushing one&apos;s teeth. The system can limit these errors, however, by calibrating the wearable devices for each patient.</p><p>Cloudera, which is partly owned by Intel, was tapped to be involved in the project as a result of its experience dealing with large data sets in the cloud. Traditional business intelligence tools would not be able to efficiently store and analyze this enormous volume of real-time and historical data, and information would be scattered in silos based on their format. To handle the terabytes&apos; worth of data from this experiment, Cloudera uses Apache HBase running on a Hadoop Distributed File System. For analysis, the company uses Yarn and Apache Spark to help break up intensive workloads into multiple tasks that can be executed in parallel.</p><p>The data platform is deployed on a cloud infrastructure optimized for Intel architecture. The cloud platform can integrate data from patients&#8217; monitoring devices, storing and analyzing data on factors such as activity levels, tremors, sleep, and gait detection.</p><p>Cloudera uses its Navigator Key Trustee to manage encryption keys and to prevent third parties from gaining access to the keys or the encrypted data. Furthermore, the data is anonymized at the smartphone level and is encrypted to comply with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA.</p><p>The functionality of the system could be expanded in the future to include even more variables such as sleep analysis, heart rate, skin temperature, respiration, calorie burning, blood flow, and so forth.</p><p>As of April of this year, 4115 people took part in the survey and completed 27,168 surveys associated with the virtual trial. <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news-detail.php?fox-insight-fuels-parkinson-research-for-one-year">A blog post from MJFF</a> reported the most frequent motor and non-motor symptoms reported by trial participants thus far.</p><p>MJFF plans to expand the trial over time. Although participants are currently limited to Parkinson&#8217;s patients with Android phones, MJFF plans on introducing an iPhone app later this year. MJFF is also open to potentially linking data from traditional clinical studies on Parkinson&#8217;s and to accept data from a variety of consumer wearable devices.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

"It is really here today."</p><p>This was the subject of Miller&apos;s opening keynote at the IndustryWeek Manufacturing & Technology Conference and Expo in Rosemont, Ill. this morning.  </p><p>In her presentation, "Manufacturing&apos;s Data-Driven and Digital Revolution," Miller pinned the OT/IT merger and the data-rich world of the Industrial Internet as the key driver for some major changes to manufacturing over the next few years.  </p><p>"The digital industrial is becoming front and center today," she explained. "It is changing industries in ways that are going to be very profound over the next couple of decades."</p><p>This change, of course, is a special interest at GE.</p><h3><strong>Brilliant Machines</strong></h3><p>"While we make very technical, complexly engineered equipment at GE&#8212;really heavy metal industrial equipment&#8212;we&apos;ve found that software and digitization are increasingly becoming a more important part of our products," Miller explained. "This physical/digital convergence is really an OT/IT revolution that we are starting to engage in."</p><p>This is the root of GE&apos;s "Brilliant Machines" campaign that has come to define the new generation of smart, sensor-laden, and software-driven machines the company has begun bringing to market over the last few years.  </p><p>These machines, Miller explained, certainly live up to the "Brilliant" label.  </p><p>For proof of this, she pointed to the latest locomotive her division launched last year.  </p><p>"This locomotive has more than 200 onboard sensors and can process over a billion structures per second," she said. "We&apos;re able to take data coming off that locomotive and off the train in real time to understand the track topology and conditions, which we combine with the train weight and length and how the locomotive is running to really optimize fuel performance for customers and optimize how that locomotive performs."</p><p>Brilliant indeed.  </p><p>But now, Miller explained, GE has taken that focus on brilliance from the equipment it produces to the plants that produce them.  </p><p>"Our next step has been to take that same vision around our external products and really think differently about how we run our manufacturing shop floors," she explained.  </p><h3>Brilliant Factory</h3><p>This process is pushing brilliance into production, creating a new network of Brilliant Factories built on the latest manufacturing technologies, sensor-enabled operations, and an industrial platform capable of leveraging industrial data in new and exciting ways.  </p><p>Tearing down the remaining walls between OT and IT and rebuilding the entire manufacturing paradigm from the data up would be a daunting challenge for any company. But for GE&#8212;with 450 factories spread across 175 countries and employing 300,000 or so workers&#8212;it seems downright impossible.  </p><p>But, as Miller sees it, this is a critical transition for both the company and the industry. If manufacturing is going to stay relevant, someone has to start the change.  </p><p>"This is a new era of manufacturing," Miller explained. "We are on a quest to really define and showcase what a GE Brilliant Factory is."  </p><p>To do this, GE started slow. The company began with 14 pilot sites to experiment with the concept and eventually selected 75 factories to transform into fully brilliant operations.  </p><p>Just a year and a half into this process, one plant in particular is already yielding results.  </p><h3><strong>Rebuilding Greenville</strong></h3><p>GE&apos;s Greenville, SC, gas turbine plant was selected for the initial Brilliant Factory pilot program. The team sensor-enabled one of the machines in just one manufacturing cell in order to understand how those machines were doing their work and how the operators were interfacing with them.  </p><p>In just three months, Millers said, the cell saw a 25% increase in productivity.  </p><p>After that, she said, the real work began.  </p><p>"We went through and we took a couple of months and we mapped every single process on the plant," she explained.

The numbers that surround it are even more so.</p><p>The port covers more than 16 square miles along the Elbe in northern Germany, its footprint close to 6% of the total area of the country&#8217;s second-most-populous city. More than 8,000 trucks pull in and out every day, activity never stopping, shifts never really ending. More than 9 million containers filled with manufactured goods are shipped out every year, with that number scheduled to double within the next decade, according to Sascha Westermann, operational IT traffic management at the Port Authority.</p><p>The problem is that the port is pretty well established, having opened in May 1189 &#8212; so long ago that it was first running under Frederick I, one of the early Holy Roman Emperors. There is next to no opportunity for expansion or change. Doubling the number of containers handled by 2025 is a matter of logistics, not just doing more with more.</p><p>Port officials focused on some solution within the ever-stretching realm of the Internet of Things, and turned to the German software company SAP. That was three years ago.</p><p>&#8220;Something like this is a journey, not a three-month project,&#8221; said Nils Herzberg, senior vice president and global co-lead for IoT go-to-market for SAP who started working on the project in November 2014. &#8220;Start with a proof of concept, try, potentially fail, change or adjust your direction, because I don&#8217;t think IoT projects are like your classical ERP projects, where you have a nine- or 18-month project and an outcome. Here, it&#8217;s more crawl, walk, run.&#8221;</p><p>The port crawled, then walked. There were loads of early questions: When is that container ship going to arrive? On time? Fifty minutes early? Fifty minutes late? Where are the trucks? Are they moving? Are they parked? Where are they parked? What about traffic patterns? Is there a jam? Are the bridges open or closed?</p><p>Piece by piece, an intricate network was created and connected. &#8220;This is a network of parties playing together and achieving things that none of them were able to achieve on their own,&#8221; Herzberg said.</p><p>One of the major improvements was better management of those 8,000 trucks, requiring more and more of them to be connected for easier communications and for pre-clearance of inventory on board. &#8220;Not everything runs on time,&#8221; Herzberg said. &#8220;About 70% of all German truck drivers arrive too early because they are afraid of the penalties, and what they do is they clog up the harbor with their trucks. So you try to keep them out, not in, and you call them when you need them.&#8221;</p><p> That one small switch saves a reported five minutes per truck per delivery, which works out to about 5,000 man hours every day. Just as important is keeping roads open not only in the port but around it, on the city&#8217;s streets and its 130 or so bridges, many of which are raised to allow ship traffic. Jams were common not only because of the port but also because of a major manufacturing center &#8220;just down the road.&#8221;</p><p>All this might sound like a supply chain solution wrapped in the glitter of technology. It is. It is also a technological solution that can be applied to any factory, no matter the size. If the port in Hamburg &#8212; the second-busiest in Europe, with constant comings and goings, so many moving parts, so many outside variables &#8212; can work out an IoT solution, can coordinating a factory floor be any more complex?</p><p>Mike Amaya works with considerably fewer outside variables, and on a smaller platform.</p><p>Amaya is the plant manager for Stanley Black & Decker&#8217;s DeWalt Power Tools plant in Reynosa, just over the Mexican border near the southern bank of the Rio Grande. His factory floor is still plenty large &#8212; about 500,000 square feet &#8212; and filled with several thousand employees working on 40 multiproduct manufacturing lines. The plant opened in 2005 and manufactures professional power tools like jigsaws, planers and cordless drills, millions every year.</p><p>&#8220;We do a lot of the components ourselves,&#8221; Amaya said. &#8220;We&#8217;re so huge that we have to make sure all our processes align. We have to get people in and out of the plant quickly and get finished goods out quickly just as well.&#8221; Amaya figured the plant could be run more efficiently, but what was the best route?</p><p>By now, everybody is at least relatively familiar with the IoT facts and figures that tech geeks and analysts like to throw around: More than 200 billion devices will be connected around the world within the next five years and the market size should hit $10 trillion around the same time. By the start of 2020, if not sooner, we&#8217;ll all wear connected watches and connected glasses, and drive our connected cars to whole connected factories and warehouses. Adapt, or wither and die. Even three years ago, though, IoT was hardly as all-encompassing as it is today.</p><p>The Reynosa lines were working at a reported 75% efficiency rate back then, when Amaya huddled with Nick DeSimone, the vice president of operations at the plant, and Gary Frederick, its CIO in the industrial and automotive repair division. They decided to turn to tech &#8212; and to industrial IoT, in particular &#8212; to curb some of those problems and increase efficient production. Production had long been monitored every hour, and more data seemed in step with keeping a constant eye on production.</p><p>The Stanley Black & Decker plant worked with Cisco to improve its wireless infrastructure, and with AeroScout Industrial, which manufactures Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) for manufacturing, aerospace, mining, and oil and gas. The solution wasn&apos;t terribly complex at the start: routers and RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags working in sync as part of the RTLS. (The plant was already hooked up with wireless, which meant one less step to take at the outset.)</p><p>The most significant immediate improvement was the RFID tags providing real-time location and status to workers on the lines, shift supervisors, and plant managers, spotting problems far more quickly than human eyes. Workers could still report problems by pressing buttons located on each line, which sent the data to the software system. Based on the button that was pressed, the software sent messages with the location and suggested how to follow up. More buttons were located at the end of each line for quality control.</p><p>The results were impressive: Line efficiency jumped to 96%, throughput improved about 10%, material inventory carrying costs dropped by 10% and, in terms of ppm, defective parts dropped 16%. Thanks to that success, Amaya and his team expanded the tech to all of the plant&#8217;s production lines, on into the warehouse, tracking materials in real time and directing them to appropriate lines.</p><p>&#8220;When production falls below a certain rate, we know there&#8217;s an issue out on the line,&#8221; Amaya said. &#8220;Our quality has improved.&#8221;</p><h3>One More Big (or Small) Number</h3><p>There is another number tied just as closely to IoT growth, quality and implementation that has been bandied about far less frequently: 1, as in 1%.</p><p>That 1% represents the productivity increase of industrial companies from 2011 through 2015, according to Jeff Immelt. As the CEO of GE, Immelt sells plenty of connected products and has an enormous business stake in the success of the industrial internet. To hear him actually talk about it, he also sounds like he would be a genuine champion for the technology even without company billions and personal millions at stake.</p><p>&#8220;The opportunity for industrial companies is to grab this next age of productivity,&#8221; Immelt said. &#8220;Productivity remains absolutely critical to the future of our industries, &#8230; and the ability to move quickly, to continue to take advantage of opportunities, has never been more important than it is today, in the volatile times we live in.</p><p>&#8220;We&apos;re in the beginning days of an entirely new industry that&apos;s all about getting productivity where it should be.&#8221;</p><p>No matter whether that means trucks pulling into ports only when they&#8217;re scheduled, or factories minimizing defective parts on dozens of lines, or your own workers improving whatever process needs it on your shop floor.</p><p>&#8220;This is real,&#8221; Immelt said. &#8220;It&apos;s driving productivity, and it&#8217;s going to be significant.&#8221; </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Many IoT projects hit delays or go over-budget. &#8220;But it&#8217;s worse than that,&#8221; says Zach Supalla, co-founder and CEO of Particle (San Francisco). &#8220;Most IoT initiatives just fail. These projects often don&#8217;t ship because the teams are responsible don&#8217;t overcome the technical challenges they are facing.&#8221;</p><p>This has become Particle&#8217;s mission: help make it easier to get IoT projects connected so developers can ship their products. In that vein, the company is launching an enterprise IoT platform to help streamline product development.</p><p>Supalla says that most IoT products don&#8217;t get off the ground because developers focus on the data application before tackling connectivity.</p><p>But if you break down an IoT device into its main elements, there are four essential ingredients:</p><ol><li>The physical device itself.</li><li>The connection between the device and the web services including device management.</li><li>Business logic with algorithms.</li><li>The data layer, which includes the collection, analysis and visualization of data.</li></ol><p>&#8220;One of the confusing things about this space is that nobody solves all four of these problems&#8212;ourselves included,&#8221; Supalla says. &#8220;We do the first and second.&#8221;</p><p>It is common for companies to focus on business logic and the data layer because this is where the value is. &#8220;But it is not the hardest part of the problem,&#8221; Supalla says. &#8220;The reason we have gotten widespread adoption is that we are not solving the problem that creates the most value for you in the long run; we are solving the problem that will be the biggest barrier to you getting there in the first place.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;A big part of the reason we have with the most widely used IoT platform has to do with user onboarding,&#8221; Supalla says. &#8220;When you create a platform, if you simplify the value proposition down to its simplest form it is: &#8216;this was hard, we&#8217;ve made it easy,&#8217;&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We can say: when you buy our platform, you are getting this Broadcom chip, you are going to run our software stack on it, plug it into the network. If you are using the cell platform, it could be powered by some combination of Telefónica, T-Mobile, and Twilio. And all of the data is going to stream into the Google Cloud. Particle will be providing the management communications protocol and all of the reference design and bits and pieces you need to get your device online.&#8221;</p><p>Still, ease of use may be the raison d&#8217;étre for most IoT development kits. &#8220;But when you get started with Particle, you plug in the kit and that device is online in 30 seconds. Then, you are writing code and pushing it out to the device, sending data to other web services within the first several minutes. Our approach to user onboarding has helped us get 70,000 engineers who are using our platform,&#8221; Supalla explains.</p><p>Companies like Keurig, Briggs Healthcare, and French utility firm Engie are already using the platform as are 20 crowdfunded startups such as Grove and CleverPet.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

If you create software and put it online, it could attract hackers eventually. The Internet of Things expands this principle, potentially giving hackers tens of billions of new targets. </p><p>But that shouldn&#8217;t deter companies from implementing IoT technologies, says noted hacker Pablos Holman (pictured below), who is speaking at <a href="http://www.iotemerge.com/iot16/Public/Enter.aspx">IoT Emerge</a>, scheduled for November 2&#8211;4 in Chicago. Because the potential business benefits of the IoT are substantial, taking a &#8220;sit and wait&#8221; approach to the technology can be fatal in this competitive marketplace. Instead, companies should map out a strategy that weighs the risks involved in being either too slow or quick in reaching the marketplace, Holman says. And instead of being fearful of hackers, they should study how they work. Cyberattacks are often as predictable as the plots of bank heist films. It turns out that there are only so many ways to launch a cyberattack, just as there are only so many ways to rob a bank.</p><p><img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/Pablos.jpg" alt="" /></p><h2>Hacking Hackers</h2><p>Businesses should come to view security as a game&#8212;one that often follows a limited number of scripts. Learning a hacker&#8217;s mindset&#8212;how to break into things as well as how to break them&#8212;can help you build better products and help you avoid being a victim.</p><p>While mainstream media tends to focus on the potential of destructive security breaches, few hackers would be interested in orchestrating such attacks. Most hackers are risk averse and would prefer to avoid doing anything that would expose their position. &#8220;Most sophisticated hackers are just going to hide and watch everything you do and learn as much as they can,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;They are going to look for something you could use as a competitive advantage, or to know when to short your stock or something like that. They do not want to get caught.&#8221;</p><p>Hackers also tend to favor easier targets rather than go after specific individuals or companies&#8212;just as sharks look for weak prey. To illustrate this principle, Holman says that merely taking a Windows 98 computer and plugging it into the Internet will attract an attack. &#8220;It is going to get owned in 23 seconds by automated hacking robots that just look for these things. Hackers don&#8217;t care what is on that machine, but it is so easy to take over, it has become systematized,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They then can use use it to launch harder and more sophisticated attacks against Windows 9 machines that are on the same network.&#8221;</p><p>Hackers can use the same modus operandi with IoT devices. &#8220;You plug in a webcam&#8212;which is a good example of an early IoT device. It is going to get automatically owned by a robot,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;And they then have something in their local network that they control and can start using that as a platform to start attacking other systems. They don&#8217;t even care what the video is showing.&#8221;</p><h2>Putting Out Bait for Hackers</h2><p>Holman recommends coming up with an active defense plan to thwart hackers. One example of that is the use of honeypots&#8212;fake targets that are easy to break into&#8212;to monitor when hackers try to break into your IoT network. &#8220;As soon as I see somebody get into it, I know it is an attacker, and then I can watch him,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;Or I can put up a few fake security cameras with poor security and see what happens there. It&#8217;s bait.&#8221;</p><p>In the security camera example, you could assume that a fairly sophisticated hacker would want to overwrite its history and replace it with fake video footage. You could then monitor for anyone trying to do that. &#8220;This is what defense is about now,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;Security guys know how to think through the threat model and what the problems are going to be and craft defense that is appropriate. It is a war of escalation. You are never going to be done.&#8221;</p><h2>Why Watching Bank Heist Films Can Help You Understand Security</h2><p>Hackers are relentless. But most cyberattacks follow scripts that are as predictable as Hollywood movies, Holman says. Even Stuxnet&#8212;a super-virus developed by Israel and the United States to destroy Iran&#8217;s nuclear centrifuges around 2010&#8212;was predictable in its own way.  &#8220;In some way, Stuxnet sounds incredibly sophisticated. But in the end, it is the same thing as the <em>Italian Job</em> or <em>Ocean&#8217;s 11</em>,&#8221; Holman explains. &#8220;It is the same thing as the bank heist that you have seen every year for your whole life.&#8221;</p><p>Stuxnet worked by recording normal activity from a nuclear facility. During the attack phase, in which it systematically attacked nuclear centrifuges, it replayed the normal log activity, to give operators the impression that nothing was wrong. &#8220;This is basically the same as those old heist movies where they plug a VCR into the security camera feed, so the security guard is watching a loop of nothing going on during a bank robbery,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;That is what Stuxnet did. It recorded when everything was fine and then played that back when, on the back end, it was destroying centrifuges.&#8221;</p><p>While Stuxnet may be a unique example, there are a limited number of scripts that hackers follow. &#8220;If you know the script, you can guess where people are going and what they are going to try,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;You can figure out what you need to monitor for to determine if somebody is trying to get into your network before they do.&#8221;</p><p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you should be afraid. &#8220;Nothing scares me anymore. That is what you learn. At some point, when you see someone launching a cyberattack, you recognize that you have seen that script before,&#8221; Holman says. &#8220;You have to play the game, and that game is pretty well defined. And that it is possible to make sure that you are not the low hanging fruit.&#8221;</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Supporting the quick growth of cities across the United States will require new approaches to city and resource management.

Emerson is evolving into a provider of products and services where digitalization enhances not just the products it makes but the power of its human resources.</p><p>CEO David Farr touched on this transformation in his note to stockholders last year.</p><p>&#8220;True solutions are more than just a product in a specific application. Solutions allow our customers to leverage vast amounts of actionable data and innovative systems to fuel smart strategies and achieve Top Quartile Performance,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;This is the Internet of Things, a space where Emerson has excelled for years. Solutions built on reliable data and combined with our extensive experience are more efficient, more effective and deliver exactly what customers need.&#8221;</p><h3>Achieving the Tesla of IoT</h3><p>For the oil business, one of Emerson&#8217;s biggest customers, efficiency has become the watchword of the industry as it struggles to make its oil and gas investments profitable.</p><p>&#8220;If you look at an offshore platform, they don&#8217;t want to drill more wells. They want to get more out of what they already have,&#8221; says Boudreaux. &#8220;The capital cost to invest in production wells is enormous. An 88% production availability platform versus a 93% production availability platform is a difference of $100 million of revenue in one year.&#8221;</p><p>For 40 years, process plants have relied on digital control systems to manufacture their products and to ensure the processes run safely. Sensors fed data on pressure, temperature, flow rates and other factors to control systems where the data was analyzed and then actions taken to keep processes within operating parameters or to shut down processes if they posed a danger.</p><p>That was the first generation of digital architecture, says Peter Zornio, chief strategic officer for Emerson, what he calls the &#8220;model T of IoT.&#8221; But now, he says, cheaper sensors, massive computing power and communication through the internet are combining to offer a new generation of systems that will not only control the plant but optimize its operations. That data can be available not just to plant operators on a local area network but through the internet to anyone in the world.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone from the Model T to the Tesla of architecture - still a car, but a very different kind of animal that what we started with,&#8221; says Zornio.</p><p>The key to taking advantage of the industrial internet of things, Zornio stresses, is to focus on the applications and the parts of your operations that you are trying to improve.</p><p>In the case of industrial valves, the problem is clear. A process facility can have hundreds of valves. The failure of even one critical valve can have devastating results. Companies try to prevent such failures by overhauling all their valves during a planned shutdown. This is not only expensive and results in a lot of unnecessary work, says Boudreaux, but can actually cause damage to some valves.</p><p>Moreover, even large facilities are thinly staffed. There may be only one valve expert at a plant and that person may be promoted, transferred or hired by a competing firm. Sustaining expertise at a facility often is not feasible, he points out.</p><p>In addition, valves can be located in remote locations that epitomize the definition of 4D &#8211; dull, distant, dirty and dangerous. Even in Houston, says Boudreaux, skilled professionals are &#8220;more interested in working in high-rise facilities than out in a plant.&#8221;</p><p>Given this gap between customer resources and what new technologies offer, Emerson is offering an increasing variety of services where it provides the expertise to monitor customers&#8217; equipment and even, in some cases, a turnkey service where it installs its equipment and then monitors and maintains it. Those services may be offered through a set monthly service contract or on an outcomes basis where the customer and Emerson establish a goal and then Emerson is remunerated for its success in meeting that goal.</p><p>Certainly, the improving economics of sensor technology and computing are making new applications more attractive. In the past, Zornio notes, sensors had to be inserted in a pipe or vessel and then wired for power and communications. The cost of installation could range from 5X to 10X the cost of the sensor itself.  But Emerson now offers a family of sensors that Zornio notes &#8220;are self-powered, easy to install and maintain and easy to get the data out of using wireless technology.&#8221;</p><p>This technology, which Emerson calls Pervasive Sensing, offers tangible differences in how plant equipment can be monitored, Zornio says. Today, he observes, you may have an employee walk around and measure vibration on a pump once a month. &#8220;You don&apos;t have real-time data. You have infrequent, manual data that a lot of times goes on a clipboard, in a stack of paper and doesn&apos;t get looked at again. With Pervasive Sensing, we are going to make it automated, real-time data that you can feed directly into a system and make use of it.&#8221;</p><p>But while cheaper sensors are helping introduce improved ways to manage plant operations, the biggest change for process industry customers, says Zornio, is that they no longer have to purchase the monitoring equipment and run it themselves. They now can purchase this function as a service from Emerson.</p><p>&#8220;As a customer, you don&apos;t just have to buy tools from us. You don&apos;t have to have guys in your own plant who can interpret that data and take action. You can just say, &#8216;Emerson, I need to lower my energy cost. Can you come in and put in the instrumentation you need, collect the data and feed that to your systems anywhere in the world so your experts can look at it and just tell me what I need to do when I need to do it?&#8221; Zornio explains. &#8220;It&apos;s a service.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>Read the rest of this article on our sister publication <a href="http://www.industryweek.com/companies-executives/inside-emersons-iot-fueled-evolution">IndustryWeek</a>.  </strong></em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

In 2006, she and a fellow student, David Gascón, from the University of Zaragoza in Spain, decided to found a company based on that idea. &#8220;David and I saw a tremendous opportunity in sensor networks and thought it would be impossible to fail,&#8221; she says.</p><p>That year, the two set about founding a hardware company focused on connected sensors that could serve an array of markets. Mentors and investors, however, didn&#8217;t like their idea. &#8220;Everyone said: &#8216;you should pick a single vertical and you shouldn&#8217;t make hardware. If you are so stupid enough to ignore those two things, you will need to raise tons of money,&#8217;&#8221; Asín recounts.</p><p>She and Gascón, however, ignored their advice and decided to bootstrap the company. &#8220;We were just 24 years old. We lacked experience. We had a small network of contacts and sometimes lacked the know-how for simple things,&#8221; Asín recounts. &#8220;But starting so young and clean was also a significant advantage.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>Hear from Alicia Asín and other experts at IoT Emerge: </strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.iotemerge.com/iot16/Public/Sessions.aspx?ID=1064519&sortMenu=103004">View the IoT Emerge agenda</a> and</strong></em><em><strong> <a href="http://www.iotemerge.com/iot16/Public/Content.aspx?ID=1064526&sortMenu=121000">register</a> using these discount codes: </strong></em><strong><em>$200 off IoT Emerge Conference or Extreme Passes: IOT200NOW / </em></strong><strong><em>Complimentary Expo Pass: IOTEXPOPASS</em></strong></p><p>For one thing, bootstrapping the company let them preserve their vision. They asked themselves: If connected sensors are going to change the world, why limit the startup&#8217;s focus on a single industry? Libelium would go on to create a horizontal hardware platform with more than 2000 customers in 115 countries. The firm&apos;s customers range from researchers monitoring the stress levels of koalas to winemakers.</p><p>In the following Q&A, we ask Asín about what she wanted to do as a child, what professional advice she would give to the future generation, and about how she expects cities to evolve.</p><p><strong>What did you want to be when you were a kid? </strong></p><p><strong>Alicia Asín:</strong> I always wanted to be an engineer. Those are the people who solve the real problems. I wanted to be able to answer practical problems with technology. </p><p><strong>What are you excited about now?  </strong></p><p><strong>Asín:</strong> First, we are living in a technological revolution and are playing a role in that. Not everyone can say they are looking at a technological revolution in the face or that they are participating in it. Second, the IoT is going to help transform cities and can improve everyone&apos;s lives. How smart cities technology can improve people&#8217;s quality of life is one of my biggest passions.</p><p>The most important thing about smart cities is not the technology&#8212;it is their effect on democracy. When we say that smart cities can improve citizens&#8217; quality of life, we mean it can give them the power to make decisions. For instance, if we can monitor air pollution cost-effectively, citizens can play a role in making decisions based on that data.  </p><p>The process of integrating data into decision making can also make cities more rational. Right now, our cities are too political and, very often, mayors don&#8217;t think long-term. They just worry how an investment will affect them orthe next mayor. But with smart cities, you can account for the good and bad things in cities more rationally.  </p><p><strong>What role do you see IoT playing in the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Asín:</strong> The IoT market is just starting to take off. It is going a little bit slower than most of the analysts have been telling us. But we are seeing smart cities and agriculture getting a lot of attention now.</p><p>Pollution is helping drive interest in smart cities. We know, for example, that 3.7 million people die every year just from outdoor air pollution.</p><p>The other big trend is smart agriculture, including everything from conventional farming and greenhouses to vineyards. There is significant pollution linked to modern agriculture, but it is not practical for farming to become more primitive to reduce that pollution. We will likely have more than nine billion people on the planet by 2050, and we will need to increase our agricultural capacity by 70 percent to feed everyone in the world. We need technology to get there.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to the next generation, Gen Z, about crafting a compelling professional career?</strong></p><p><strong>Asín:</strong> I think that flexibility has never been so important as it is now. We are living in a technologically driven world that is more fragmented than ever. You have to stay adaptable. The faster you can learn new things, the better. </p><p>For companies, it is not about hiring people who have all of the knowledge. That is impossible anyway. There is a real risk in becoming very specialized. We need people capable of taking a holistic approach to anything. It&#8217;s about hiring people who can learn quickly and adapt.  </p><p>Of course, technical skills are also needed. Everyone is talking about the billions of devices that will be connected by 2020, but nobody is talking about the 4.1-million developers gap that we will have then. There is a lack of hardware and software engineer and data scientists.</p><p>With Industrie 4.0, it&#8217;s not about the CEO controlling sensors in the factory. It is about having the whole board monitoring the KPIs. It is a new way of connecting all of the isolated data in a company&#8212;or anyplace&#8212;and being capable of making conclusions and decisions. It is like a conductor being able to lead the orchestra and hear all of the instruments play together to form the melody.</p><p><strong>You have a clear passion for smart cities. What drives your motivation there?</strong></p><p><strong>Asín:</strong> I think cities are one of the big icons of humanity&#8217;s progress and I love living in a city where you can get everything. I am also aware that this model is not a very sustainable. If we can find a way to make cities more sustainable, that would be perfect.  </p><p><strong>One of the challenges with the IoT how vast it is. How do you deal with that?</strong></p><p><strong>Asín:</strong> If you are asking for a secret sauce or something like that, the best thing we have done is to become an ecosystem company. We acknowledge what we were and what we weren&#8217;t. When we said we wanted to be horizontal, we thought it was too risky to pick any single market. Being horizontal enables us to collaborate with all of the big companies without competing against them. We can work with them and help them solve interoperability problems. Because we offer both hardware and software as well as a communications protocol, it gives us a stronger position to collaborate.</p><p>This philosophy was behind our decision to launch an IoT ecosystem. We wanted to have a place for solutions from the ecosystem partners. In a world where you need to be so fast and holistic&#8212;watching everything, at the end of the day, you only do one thing. You are forced to cooperate to be effective. IoT is going to be so huge; no one is going to be able to cover it all themselves.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Traffic coming from tens of millions of IP addresses, including IoT devices such as surveillance cameras and home routers, flooded Dyn servers and brought down popular websites.</p><p>Netflix, Twitter, Spotify, Airbnb, Github, among others, suffered outages at various times of the day.</p><p>Today&apos;s troubles, however, were foreshadowed earlier this month when a hacker published the Mirai source code. <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/blame-the-internet-of-things-for-destroying-the-internet-today">Security researches say</a> the malicious code isn&apos;t particularly sophisticated but doesn&apos;t have to be, given weak default logins and passwords of simple IoT devices. Last week, Level 3, an internet service provider, reported 493,000 devices had been infected with Mirai malware.</p><p>"All the code needed was 61 different combinations of username and passwords to create this giant botnet," Chase Cunningham, PhD, a former U.S. Navy chief cryptologic technician who supported U.S. Special Forces and Navy Seals in Iraq, <a href="http://www.ioti.com/security/why-iot-security-zombie-marathon-qa">told Internet of Things Institute</a> earlier this month. "It just takes seconds to grab a device and use it for botnet or DDoS."</p><p>Cunningham ran a query with some code looking for devices that identify themselves as "IoT." He says he found 3,551 devices just "sitting for somebody waiting to tell them what to do."</p><p>Apparently, someone told them what to do today. Speaking on a livestream, Dale Drew, chief security officer at Level 3, says he found evidence that roughly 10 percent of all devices infected by Mirai were being used to attack Dyn&apos;s servers.</p><p>Even worse, Mirai portends a darker future. If Cisco&apos;s prediction comes to pass -- a world where 50 billion things will be connected to the Internet by the year 2020 -- and hackers can seize control so that many devices mindlessly do their bidding, then we&#8217;ll be living in a new kind of zombie apocalypse.</p><p>"I have this running joke that I tell people: It is like being in a zombie marathon," Cunningham says.</p><p>A distributed denial-of-service attack is only one action a hacker of IoT devices can take. Cunningham worries about power grids and other critical infrastructure being compromised. If a water treatment plant is using an automated IoT-enabled chemical induction system, he says, someone may be able to hack into it and dump chlorine and other chemicals into the water to sicken citizens.</p><p>"Unfortunately, pain is the greatest teacher there is," Cunningham says. "Until we really feel some sort of physical or financial or societal pain from this IoT security issue, it is not going to be anything other than a line item on a budget."</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Brian Buntz.</em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

There are antagonists who say IoT is mostly just marketing speak and that we have been doing IoT ever since the shift to digital sensors and control technology three decades ago. They believe it&apos;s just another acronym, M2M for machine-to-machine communication that appeared on the scene at the turn of the millennium. These, unfortunately, have a shortsighted view of IoT. Proponents who believe IoT is transformative and will cause a shift across industry are correct, but some are overly optimistic as to how fast this transformation can and will occur.</p><p>LNS Research has surveyed several thousand companies on their initiatives related to Smart Manufacturing and Digital Transformation. Across all industries, there is improvement in acknowledging what IoT offers and its ability to transform business. However, actual use cases, beyond pilot programs, remain stubbornly limited. We can attribute part of this to the conservative posture of manufacturing where the phrase "if it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it" probably originated.</p><p><strong>Related: LNS Research&apos;s Dan Miklovic will be speaking at the <a href="http://www.iotemerge.com/iot16/Public/Enter.aspx">IoT Emerge conference</a>, McCormick Place, Chicago, November 2-4.

Much of the real power of IoT devices is dependent on the deployment of new technology platforms, and retrofitting only offers partial benefits. With capital investment stifled in an economy that is still recovering, new investments face high hurdles. Because of this, we see the projects that are being used to justify IoT investment often centered around predictive capabilities, particularly as it applies to asset performance. Since asset reliability and performance has productivity, safety, and quality implications, it is an area where investments have the biggest payoff and is where many of the pilot projects are bearing fruit.</p><p>Today&apos;s IoT, at least in manufacturing, creates new opportunities that previous M2M technologies were unable to deliver, thanks to two primary factors:</p><p>1. IIoT is based on a platform approach (Figure 1)</p><p>2. IIoT is giving us a wealth of data, which when coupled with Big Data Analytics, is providing insight into our manufacturing processes that was simply not achievable in the past.</p><p><img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/LNS%20Platform.png" alt="" width="800" height="483" /></p><p>Companies must consider and include four key elements when deploying an IIoT platform:</p><p>1. Connectivity ? Includes all necessary hardware and software to network within the plant and the enterprise, standards for integrating machines, Clouds, applications and the technology for quickly and efficiently managing devices, moving data, and triggering events.</p><p>2. Cloud ? Includes all of the various Clouds across an enterprise to implement computing and storage capabilities wherever they are most needed: at the edge, within the plant, at the enterprise, or outside the firewall.</p><p>3. Application Development ? Includes the needed tools for quickly and easily creating new mashup software applications that leverage all other areas of the IIoT platform, as well as quickly and easily moving existing legacy applications on top of the platform.</p><p>4. Big Data & Analytics ? Includes the use of a broad set of statistical and optimization tools to cleanse, monitor, and analyze both structured and unstructured data for enabling unprecedented insights.</p><p><img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/LNS%20Analytics.png" alt="" width="800" height="843" /></p><p>New insight is the value that IIoT delivers through Big Data & Analytics (Figure 2). This is where leaders today see real ROI on their IIoT investments. In some cases, the benefits are from being able to use their existing analysis tools to look at new sources of more varied data. It enables companies to get new and better answers to existing questions they may have already had like predicting machine reliability. But the real payback from IIoT investments is not just in doing the same old things better, faster or cheaper. The real payoff is when companies use advanced analytics to get new answers to questions they never even knew they had. This is the power that organizations need to have to radically transform their businesses.</p><p>Nowhere is this more relevant than in companies that are trying to deliver IoT-enabled products themselves. LNS holds that "you can&apos;t build smart products in dumb factories." To remain competitive, companies either have to start providing smart products, deliver value-added services, or both. We already see examples such as the often cited jet engine sector where GE and Rolls Royce essentially sell thrust instead of the engine itself. Others will have to follow suit as LNS already sees this model taking root in industries from mining to agriculture.</p><hr /><p><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/lns%20logo.png" alt="" width="100" height="91" /><em>LNS Research provides advisory and benchmarking services to help Line-of-Business and IT executives make critical decisions.

Graham opened with the song, which contains the refrain &#8220;Hey, every day&#8217;s a revolution. Welcome to the future.&#8221;</p><p>In the episode, Graham interviewed three top executives in the field of industrial machinery and components (IM&C). She asked about changes in global manufacturing caused by the fourth Industrial Revolution. Listen to <a href="https://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/91459/digital-manufacturing-powering-the-4th-industrial-revolution">podcast 1</a> and <a href="https://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/92655/digital-manufacturing-powering-the-4th-industrial-revolution-part-2">podcast 2</a> to learn more.</p><p>Graham said that collaborative robotics &#8211; the field of machine-to-machine communication &#8211; is one of the major changes created by this digital transformation of manufacturing.</p><h2><strong>About the four Industrial Revolutions</strong></h2><p>Water and steam power mechanized production during the first Industrial Revolution. Electricity powered the second. The third Industrial Revolution began in the 1960s, when digital innovators developed information technology and used electronics to automate production.</p><p>The fourth Revolution is a whirlwind of digital change building on the third. It involves the Internet of Things. The IoT connects a broad array of objects to the Internet and makes machine-to-machine (M2M) communication possible. The IoT helps create a broad ecoweb of productivity in manufacturing.</p><p>Graham interviewed Sean Molloy of itelligence, Jason Coffman of Deloitte Consulting, and me about how rapid digital change is affecting manufacturing worldwide.</p><p>Here are some of the points we covered.</p><h2><strong>IoT improvement of margin</strong></h2><p>Sean Molloy is the IM&C Industry Solution principal for the company itelligence.  He noted that digital changes in manufacturing are transforming ordinary objects into high-value products when connected to the Internet. He said there is opportunity to reap rewards by transforming common items into IoT objects.</p><p>Automobile radios are a good example, Molloy said. He explained that the first auto manufacturers to link radios to Bluetooth technology were able to charge a premium price. The Bluetooth technology allowed drivers to talk hands-free on smartphones, listen to driving directions, and stream music.</p><p>Molloy said that manufacturers need to move quickly when they see such an opportunity. Value and profit margins decrease &#8220;as a product matures in the marketplace.&#8221;</p><p>He added that many manufacturers continue to pursue profit through sales volumes on standard objects. Instead they should be connecting the objects to the Internet for greater profit.</p><h2><strong>Social media and manufacturing</strong></h2><p>In my comments, I emphasized the importance for manufacturers of taking social media seriously.</p><p>Few manufacturers or their customers knew much about interacting on social media eight years ago. Yet, today most of them are very social savvy.</p><p>The information customers share via social media gives companies data similar to that of a feedback group. Product improvement happens quickly if companies pay attention to this data when it is fresh.</p><h2><strong>Broad picture of connectedness</strong></h2><p>Jason Coffman is the manufacturing principal for Deloitte Consulting. He added to the conversation about product improvement through connection to the IoT. Coffman called the IoT web of devices the &#8220;broader picture&#8221; of digital connectedness.</p><p>Coffman said manufacturers do need to add digital improvements to products.  Manufacturers also should communicate with customers and manufacturers via social media. And they need to ask themselves how digital change can improve business-to-business interactions.</p><p>General Electric&#8217;s <a href="http://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/12528/jet-engines-are-they-owned-by-the-airline-or-just-rented">Power-by-the-Hour</a> jet engine program is a good example, he said. It sorts &#8220;massive amounts of data&#8221; rapidly to provide better service to B2B customers, Coffman added.</p><h2><strong>Fine tuning industrial robots</strong></h2><p>I expanded the discussion to the M2M capabilities of IoT devices, responding to Graham&#8217;s question about how industrial pump makers are using IoT sensors.</p><p>While water pump guys are really on the forefront of this kind of connectivity, changes in robotics are a very profound change. Industrial robots have traditionally been locked in cages, because people who entered their space could be harmed.</p><p>However, advancements in the use of sensors have enabled industrial robots to sense people approaching them. The robots slow down and completely stop. This allows robots to work with ease in the same manufacturing line as people.</p><p>The IoT has taken M2M one step further by creating machine-to-human responses.</p><h2><strong>Cybersecurity and information overload</strong></h2><p>We concluded the interview by all discussing the need to improve the security of Internet-enabled factories and the challenge of coping with Big Data overload. Companies are gathering data about the manufacturing process, customer needs, and security protocols.</p><p>Molloy said that the cybersecurity industry is maturing along with digital changes in manufacturing. &#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at the end of the day, we are going to be able to transact in a fairly safe world and be very successful with the Internet of Things.&#8221;</p><p>I noted that the cybersecurity industry is expected to grow to a $2 billion market within four years. People realize there is an opportunity to make some money, to be good at it, and also just to protect the greater good if you will.</p><p>Of course, all this data gathering increases information overload. This overload will make manufacturers need statisticians more than ever. It&#8217;s an old field that is updating and moving into new prominence.</p><p>Statisticians will become data scientists, Coffman concluded. These scientists will give manufacturers advanced analytics explaining connected interactions of machines. Manufacturers also will be able to see what is shaping customer behavior. Then they can make products and services for consumers and help workers in &#8220;running their shop floor.&#8221;</p><p> </p><p>This blog appeared originally on <a href="http://www.digitalistmag.com/">http://www.digitalistmag.com/</a></p><p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p><h2><strong>David Parrish</strong></h2><h3> <img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/david-parrish.jpg" alt="" /></h3><h3><strong>About David Parrish</strong></h3><p>David Parrish is the senior global director of Industrial Machinery & Components Solutions Marketing for SAP.

Now, many people are wondering how hackers could have shut down a significant chunk of the Internet in one fell swoop. Here&#8217;s a chronological summary of events leading up to the historic botnet attack.</p><p><strong>September 8: Krebs Dishes Dirt on DDoS </strong><br />Security guru Brian Krebs posted an article about a DDoS attack-for-service site known as vDOS. He claimed that the site earned $600,000 in two years. Hours after posting, authorities in Israel arrested two of the alleged operators of the site.</p><p>In one of his posts, Krebs wrote that: &#8220;To say that vDOS has been responsible for the vast majority of DDoS attacks in recent years. From April to July 2016, the service launched roughly 8.81 years worth of attack traffic.&#8221; The service offered &#8220;IP stresser&#8221; services for as little as $29.99 monthly.</p><p><strong>September 20: Krebs and Dyn Write about BackConnect, the Security Firm That Hacks Hackers</strong><br />Krebs wrote how a DDoS mitigation firm known as BackConnect admitted to hacking hundreds of Internet addresses in Europe to learn more about hackers targeting the company. In an email to Krebs, Bryant Townsend, CEO of the business, confirmed the company had launched a border gateway protocol hijack on the hack-for-hire company vDOS but stated it was a &#8220;defensive&#8221; maneuver.</p><p>Dyn also wrote a blog post on the subject, titled <a href="http://research.dyn.com/2016/09/backconnects-suspicious-bgp-hijacks/">BackConnect&#8217;s Suspicious BGP Hijacks</a>, which claims that BackConnect had often spoofed Internet addresses using the BGP hijack technique. </p><p>That same day, Krebs saw his web server attacked in what was one of the biggest DDoS attacks to date. Hackers would hit Dyn later.</p><p>BackConnect would later state that it had nothing to do with the attack. </p><p><strong>September 23: Akamai Drops Support for Krebs</strong><br />The content delivery network Akamai announced that it would stop providing free DDoS protection services to Brian Krebs. The company had protected Krebs from 250 DDoS attacks over the course of four years but stated that it would be too expensive to fend off future attacks of the same magnitude of the assault against Krebs. Google would step in two days later to protect his website as part of its Project Shield</p><p><strong>October 1: Source Code for Mirai Goes Open Source</strong><br />The source code for the &#8220;Mirai&#8221; that attacked the web server of Brian Krebs was released on a hackers&#8217; forum.</p><p>&#8220;The author probably felt threatened. &#8230; either by someone close to them or law enforcement was closing in on them,&#8221; says Thomas Pore, director of IT and services of Plixer. &#8220;Should someone grab their laptop, you don&#8217;t want to be the only person holding that source code. So when you flood that out to Github, many security researchers as well as malicious actors are going to pull that code.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t typically see someone who has something possibly as powerful as this is release the source code unless they are really freaked out about getting in trouble for it. It is a way to cover your tracks. You don&#8217;t usually see that,&#8221; agrees Chase Cunningham, Ph.D., A10 Networks&#8217; director of cyber operations.</p><p><strong>October 19: Dyn Speaks on BackConnect&apos;s Use of BGP Hijacks</strong><br />Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at the DNS company Dyn, gives a talk on DDoS at NANOG, the North American Network Operators Group. In his talk, Madory shares his perspective on BackConnect&#8217;s attacks against vDos. He states that BackConnect is likely the first security company to confirm its use of a BGP hijack to intercept traffic.</p><p><strong>October 21: Botnet Shuts Down Much of the Internet<br /></strong>Dyn is attacked, causing one of the biggest ever Internet outages. Twitter, Amazon, Spotify, and Reddit were all hit, affecting millions of people in the United States. Dyn stated that the attack began about 7:10 a.m. EST and that it relaunched service about two hours later. It would be hit later by another attack that also targeted the West Coast.</p><p>The malware took control of many web cameras, DVRs, and other connected devices. The main vulnerability in the connected devices was the use of default username and passwords, but the malware could also use a brute-force dictionary attack to crack most passwords.  </p><p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t really anything crazy complicated about the attack,&#8221; says Chase Cunningham, Ph.D., A10 Networks&#8217; director of cyber operations. &#8220;It was basically somebody who wrote up code that went out and looked for vulnerable DVRs and cameras and, once you grab those, most of them have default passwords and configurations or a very weak password and configurations, you can send those things off to fire at whatever target you want.&#8221;</p><p>One of the biggest components of the botnet were industrial security cameras and the DVRs hooked up to them. Many of the devices involved in the attack were more than a decade old. &#8220;You can think of webcams as being the prototypical IoT device,&#8221; says security expert Pablos Holman. They are the first non-computer thing we hook onto the Internet. They are tiny little shitty computers. We have been making them for 10, 15 years ago and most of them were designed and deployed once and were forgotten about. And many of them don&#8217;t have any system updates. They are running software that has not been updated in a decade.&#8221;</p><p>Also on this day, WikiLeaks supporters linked the organization to the attacks. </p><p><strong>October 22<br /></strong>The hacker group calling themselves &#8220;New World Hackers&#8221; claimed responsibility for last Friday&apos;s Mirai attack on its Twitter account @NewWorldHacking, boasting that it had &#8220;broke a couple records&#8221; but added that the group had retired. <strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>October 23<br /></strong>The American grey hat hacker &#8220;The Jester&#8221; defaced a Russian government website, stating that it was retaliation for Friday&apos;s Mirai attack. He posted on the website: &#8220;Stop attacking Americans.&#8221;</p><p><strong>October 24&#8211;25: Vendors and Government Begin to Address the Botnet Risk<br /></strong>On October 24, the Chinese firm XiongMai Technologies, which made some devices used in Friday&#8217;s DDoS attack, announced that it was recalling millions of its connected devices. The company also threatened legal action against media companies it thinks are spreading information. "Mirai is a huge disaster for the internet of things," said Hangzhou Xiongmai Technologies spokesman Cooper Wang. </p><p>Also on this day, Malwaretech would claim that 196,000 devices across the world were infected with Mirai. Later that night, President Obama said the White House didn&#8217;t know who launched the massive attack.</p><p>On October 25, Virginia Senator Mark Warner (D) sent letters to the FCC, FTC, and Department of Homeland Security calling for an investigation into the threat of the large number of insecure IoT devices.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

"Things are not people."</p><p>While that notion may seem spectacularly obvious, Chou stressed that its implications of it are profound and often overlooked. "You can buy a book from Amazon and process purchase orders or find people to hire over the Internet. But these applications are all basically assuming that it is a human at the other end. [...] If we want to talk about the IoT, we have to recognize that things are not people."</p><p>He went on to list five ways in which things are not people:</p><ol><li><strong>There are way more things than people.</strong> According to some predictions for the IoT, there will be 100 times more connected things than the global population in coming years.</li><li><strong>Things can be where people cannot&#8212;</strong>at the bottom of a mineshaft, the middle of the Gobi Desert, even in your stomach.</li><li><strong>Things have a lot more things to say than people.</strong> A wind turbine, for example, might have 500 sensors on it. "It has way more to say about air pressure, barometric pressure, and other conditions than any human would ever have to say," explained Chou.</li><li><strong>Things can say it more frequently</strong>&#8212;the data rates coming off of these new things are much faster than any of us can type.</li><li><strong>Things can be programmed.</strong> People cannot.</li></ol><p>Bottom line? Our frame of reference needs to change from thinking that the only way that we could communicate with a machine was through a keyboard. "Merely taking the stuff that we are currently doing is trivial," stressed Chou. "Most machines today are pretty dumb. I&apos;ve looked at a lot of them, and not many have much computational power.</p><p>Chou sees a whole new shift of technology underneath, including the use of some advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. </p><p>But people aren&apos;t there yet. "it&apos;s going to be the people building the machines that will be leading the charge," predicted Chou. "As they start to make their machines smarter, it will be an obvious path to connect them."</p><p>He went on to say that once your machine is connected to a computer, companies can now provide their customers with more assistance. "We are already starting to see this, in one case they are building equipment that connects up to locomotives. They pull a lot of data and learn from it and provide the operator with assistance, say, "speed up here, slow down there. Improve fuel economy." </p><p>And that, he said, just leads to the realization that if you can assist someone in it, you can do it. And soon as you do it you can start shifting the biz model. You can tell your customers, well you don&#8217;t need to own this anymore. I will manage everything for you.</p><p>"You can say, I don&#8217;t have to be in the compressor business; I can be in the air-as-a-service business. As soon as you do that, the light bulb is on. If you are first to do that you can clean out your competition," stressed Chou. "All it takes is a couple leaders in a company to start moving things forward. They cannot afford to ignore this conversation."</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

As we head into a new year, security will become a sharper focus for the young Internet of Things industry but a small talent pool of security professionals will make it challenging to keep up with hackers.</p><p><strong>1. Embedded Security Will Finally Get Serious</strong> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the topic of embedded security pops up fairly often, it is easier to pay lip service to the concept than to actually build security into hardware. That is changing, says Robert Vamosi, security strategist with Synopsys. &#8220;Devices, once thought to be too small to include their own security, will undergo a more thorough analysis beginning with firmware testing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The software inside the chip is just as important as the application controlling it. Both need to be tested for security and quality. Some of the early IoT botnets have leveraged vulnerabilities and features within the device itself.&#8221;</span></p><p><strong>2. Inspecting the Cyber Supply Chain Becomes a Priority</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party software is rampant but is often not sufficiently tested. &#8220;Some of the early IoT botnets have leveraged vulnerabilities and features within third-party chipsets found inside the devices themselves,&#8221; says Robert Vamosi of Synopsys. &#8220;Understanding the bill of materials for the software components found in each chipset added will become important as IoT vendors rush to protect themselves from expensive recalls.&#8221;</span></p><p><strong>3. IoT-Fueled DDoS Attacks Will Remain a Problem</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little that can be done for now to avert DDoS attacks like the Mirai botnet that brought down much of the internet in October. One factor that could help is if industry and regulators require ISPs to start playing a more active role managing network traffic. There would, however, be &#8220;a different set of costs to Internet users in security and privacy concerns&#8221; if this were to happen, says Todd Inskeep, advisory board member for</span><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.rsaconference.com_&d=DgMFaQ&c=H98lxvesFHsl1ZPcztRg4g&r=eNFdvvTxEzrVpUeor-QASNhBy46IvbkqKI2O4r0pgPM&m=km9Y6kOGz4dh63FB70CkCHtk1VkTlxIRZWAFhLvt0sM&s=mfbo_0kcD8YPaqpG2VFcwqHNoCWJAANMWvV09TpXynU&e="> <span style="font-weight: 400;">RSA Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Longer term, we could think about security requirements for all Internet enabled-devices, but that comes with its own set of issues: which requirements, who verifies compliance. This could lead to conflicting security concerns in different regions and geographies,&#8221; Inskeep says. &#8220;The internet was designed to be open and resilient, assuming that all the actors were self-interested to be at least benign if not helpful. Instead, we continue to find individuals, organizations, and apparently nation-states with malicious intent.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there are things that companies and individuals can do reduce the power of botnets. According to</span> Trevor Hawthorn, CTO of<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.wombatsecurity.com_&d=DgMFaQ&c=H98lxvesFHsl1ZPcztRg4g&r=eNFdvvTxEzrVpUeor-QASNhBy46IvbkqKI2O4r0pgPM&m=km9Y6kOGz4dh63FB70CkCHtk1VkTlxIRZWAFhLvt0sM&s=ikfb178Bnf9abhThxMSZKVHt0MzWj_N9jv8DwvAwbQ0&e="> Wombat Security</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are three most steps people can take to avert botnet problems. First, don&#8217;t allow IoT devices to be exposed to the open internet. &#8220;This is probably the most important consideration,&#8221; he says. Second, ensure IoT devices are kept up to date. Third, change all default passwords on all devices.</span></p><p><strong>4. Companies with IoT Projects Will Try to Think Like Hackers</strong></p><p> In 1993, Saturday Night Live aired a skit that poked fun of the auto industry&#8217;s strategies of protecting vehicles using solely alarms and steering wheel locks like the Club.</p><p> &#8220;In the nineties, you don&#8217;t need a car to tell the world you are wealthy. But you do need a car to tell the world you are smart.&#8221; The answer is a car, the Chameleon XLE, that looks like a piece of junk from the outside but offers luxury within and a strong engine under the hood. &#8220;A car thief takes one look at this, and keeps right on walking,&#8221; explained the mock ad.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although a joke, the SNL skit highlights the need for thinking like a criminal. Both cybercriminals and car thieves are drawn to valuable targets that can be easily broken into. Organizations with IoT devices should focus not just making their products more secure, but also on understanding why attackers are drawn to their products in the first place and how they can make them less attractive targets. </span></p><p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.ioti.com/security/security-experts-shed-light-mirai-botnet">Security Experts Shed Light on the Mirai Botnet</a></strong></p><p>In the technology field, many have struggled with security, even though the same basic threats have remained similar for decades. &#8220;IoT threats are fundamentally the same threats we&apos;ve been trying to manage for the last 20 years: malicious actors (individuals, organizations, and nation-states) trying to gain advantage by disrupting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services,&#8221; says Todd Inskeep, Advisory Board Member for RSA Conference.</p><p> IoT devices, however, open up new territory when it comes to information and services. &#8220;These new devices process different kinds of information, and are more likely than previous devices to have real-world impacts,&#8221; Inskeep says. &#8220;An IoT device in a manufacturing line could be disrupted to mix chemicals in the wrong proportions. An IoT device at home might be hackable to unlock a door, or share videos from inside a company with people outside the company. While these threats are the same, the risks may be very different.&#8221;</p><p><strong>5. Finding IoT Security Talent Will Stay Tough</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for security professionals throughout the entire tech industry outstrips supply. The IoT industry is no different, says Todd Inskeep, advisory board member for</span><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.rsaconference.com_&d=DgMFaQ&c=H98lxvesFHsl1ZPcztRg4g&r=eNFdvvTxEzrVpUeor-QASNhBy46IvbkqKI2O4r0pgPM&m=km9Y6kOGz4dh63FB70CkCHtk1VkTlxIRZWAFhLvt0sM&s=mfbo_0kcD8YPaqpG2VFcwqHNoCWJAANMWvV09TpXynU&e="> <span style="font-weight: 400;">RSA Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;It&apos;s a challenge for all industries to find security talent,&#8221; agrees Trevor Hawthorn, CTO of Wombat Security. &#8220;Well-funded and well-known vendors will have an easier time. The problem is that the flood of small, cheap products are made by offshore manufacturers that have a poor security track record. As we have seen, offshore IoT device manufacturers are not that interested in security to begin with, so they would likely have a hard time finding talent if they were looking.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the product security industry will be well-served to draw on existing security models. &#8220;We&apos;ve seen the rise of a new category of security professional - chief product security officer, and their support staff, the product security officer and product security engineer, but the people in these roles often say they thought they were the only one,&#8221; Inskeep says. There&apos;s a variety of requirements documentation relevant to these professionals including NIST&apos;s FIPS-140 for hardware and the globally recognized Common Criteria model for software and systems. Another example is the more software-focused Building Security In Maturity Model.</span></p><p><strong>6. Situational Awareness Becomes a Bigger Security Objective</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the forecasts of billions of IoT devices blanketing the planet, it becomes critical to keep track of which devices are deployed where. But it is easy to lose track. &#8220;With IoT devices deployed within IPv4 networks, organizations should be able to scan or &#8216;see&#8217; what IoT devices are deployed on their networks,&#8221; says</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Trevor Hawthorn of Wombat Security</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;With IPv6, it is possible to have so many IPv6 addresses that it is near impossible to scan your perimeter. Organizations will need to focus on other methods to keep a handle on what they have and what is exposed.&#8221;</span></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

According to conventional wisdom, the concept of planned obsolescence quickly became entrenched in modern business, becoming the "new god&#8221; of the American business elite in the late 1920s, according to Paul Mazur, a partner at Lehman Brothers at that time.</p><p>While it might sound like a conspiracy theory, the concept of planned obsolescence has dominated business for nearly a century. Rather than building processes to last, businesses have banked on selling their products as frequently as reasonably possible.</p><p>But the concept of designing products to break at a predetermined interval is becoming passé. The companies that are most successful don&#8217;t merely focus on selling products. They focus on their customers&#8217; desired outcome.</p><p>&#8220;This reminds me of the original first IoT use case,&#8221; says social media business strategist Evan Kirstel, recounting how, in 1982, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University devised the first Internet-connected appliance, a Coke-machine that can report its inventory and determine when newly loaded drinks were cold enough to drink. &#8220;Who the hell wants to drink lukewarm soda?&#8221; Kirstel asks. </p><p>Yet, in the past few years, many Internet of Things devices offer a link to the Internet without offering much else. &#8220;Just putting a smart sensor onto an existing &#8216;thing&#8217; does not necessarily add a ton of value,&#8221; says Michael Beamer, president of goTransverse. &#8220;Most of the value lies in wrapping services around products.&#8221;</p><p>Look at John Deere. &#8220;They are not just selling tractors and combines anymore,&#8221; Beamer says. &#8220;They are also selling precision agricultural services that help boost the efficiency of planting, feeding, and harvesting.&#8221;</p><p><img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/profit.gif" alt="" /></p><p><strong>This graphic, inspired by a South Park episode, reveals the curious strategy of many early Internet of Things projects. </strong></p><p>&#8220;You have to be able to put yourself in the shoes of your customer,&#8221; Beamer says. &#8220;If I want to achieve energy efficiency, do I just go buy a Nest? No. That is only part of the equation.&#8221; Instead of just installing a smart thermostat, a home or business owner should think about all of the energy components in a building. &#8220;I need to think about my desired outcome and then ask what services I will need to achieve that.&#8221;</p><p>It is certainly not easy, however, for companies with decades of experiments selling products to come up with service offerings and ways to monetize them. Technologies such as the Internet of Things also have the potential to drive substantial value-chain-based productivity advances, explains Michael Porter in Harvard Business Review. An era of smart, connected products opens up a new realm of technological possibilities and should lead enterprise leaders to rethink their business from the ground up. &#8220;Experimentation is key,&#8221; Beamer notes. &#8220;You have to be willing to try out different ways of packaging and pricing your service offerings.&#8221;</p><p>As Gartner has observed, however, companies aiming to maximize agility and experimentation must have a conducive culture and governance. Enterprises in the midst of digital transformation need to balance current business needs with disruption.</p><p>While many companies are too timid when it comes to digital transformation programs, being too aggressive is another common pitfall. &#8220;Some companies are trying to boil the ocean. They want to identify a problem and solve it forever,&#8221; Beamer says. &#8220;They get caught in a big churn. Having agility is key.

It&apos;s the latest and largest acquisition in CEO Brian Jellison&apos;s more-than-a-decade-long push to distance Roper from the cost-intensive manufacturing of its past and establish the company as one of the most profitable and fast-growing industrial firms within the S&P 500.</p><p>You&apos;d be hard-pressed to find a major industrial manufacturer that isn&apos;t going digital these days, but only a select few have opted to actually become software purveyors and even fewer have been at this game as long as Roper. Executives at the company know this: earlier this year, Jellison called out industrial companies that are running ads trying to attract programmers (read General Electric Co.) and noted that there were a number of  "Johnny-come-latelys" to the concept of software who have "got their work cut out for them."</p><p>Roper&apos;s edge, however, isn&apos;t just its head start, but the fact that it&apos;s figured out how and where it wants to compete in software. Roper isn&apos;t trying to best SAP or Oracle Corp. at their own game and it also isn&apos;t trying to sell software to its own industrial competitors. Executives are instead focused on niche markets where the company can become part of an oligopoly and command high margins. That&apos;s led Roper to buy businesses like legal software-maker Aderant, which primarily competes with Thomson Reuters Corp.&apos;s Elite offering, or Sunquest, which like Cerner Corp. helps health-care providers streamline the laboratory testing process.</p><p>Deltek fits that same mold. While it&apos;s hardly the only provider of enterprise-resource planning software, the company primarily caters to government contractors, which tend to have more inertia when it comes to switching technology providers. Arguably, it&apos;s a business that the likes of SAP SE perhaps should have acquired. Roper got to it first, though, and that&apos;s going to be a difficult market to attack from the outside.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.ioti.com/industrial-iot/why-iot-different-past-technology-evolutions">Why IoT Is Different Than Past Technology Evolutions</a></strong></p><p>In general, these aren&apos;t sexy or moonshot businesses a la the Internet of Things or 3-D printing upstarts that GE&apos;s pursuing, but they&apos;re stable and generate heaps of cash that can be used for further digital expansion.</p><p>Deltek, for example, is on track to earn $200 million of Ebitda on $535 million of revenue in 2017. That&apos;s an Ebitda margin of 37 percent, unheard of among traditional industrials. Even though it&apos;s relatively old in the software world, Deltek&apos;s growth rates aren&apos;t shabby, especially stacked against the part of Roper&apos;s business that provides monitoring and control systems to the oil and gas industry. Deltek&apos;s organic expansion has ranged between 4 percent and 8 percent over the last four years. Roper isn&apos;t overpaying for that growth either at a little over 5 times Deltek&apos;s projected revenue.  </p><p>That&apos;s a value proposition that&apos;s easy for shareholders to understand. By comparison, GE&apos;s goal of generating $15 billion in digital sales by 2020 has drawn skepticism from some investors who question how much of that revenue can really be considered additional. For example, part of the appeal of a GE jet engine is the superior predictive maintenance offerings and data analytics that come with it. Can GE sell those services separately or is that already embedded in the value of the engine? The digital business is still nascent, but so far it doesn&apos;t appear to be having a material impact on GE&apos;s organic growth.</p><p>The other big question mark surrounding GE&apos;s digital push is whether other manufacturing companies will feel comfortable buying data-management software from one of their biggest rivals. And of course, there is the risk that Oracle, International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp. or any other big software company decides to stop working with GE and start trying to market Internet of Things offerings to industrial companies on their own. </p><p>At this point, it&apos;s still too to soon to make a judgment about GE&apos;s digital efforts. But at least when it comes to acquisitions, investors are giving Roper&apos;s strategy a bigger thumbs-up. GE has struck at least nine software deals so far this year, costing the company more than $2.5 billion in total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On average, shares of the industrial giant have declined after each of those acquisitions was announced.</p><p>Roper, meanwhile, gained as much as 2.1 percent on Tuesday and climbed 3.22 percent in October after announcing a $632 million deal to buy ConstructConnect, a software provider that caters to the construction industry.</p><p>Roper may not be dreaming as big as GE, but so far its approach is paying off.</p><p class="news-disclaimer-text"><em>This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.</em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

The tools, called Conversation Actions, will let companies and other third parties interact with Google users by building bots that answer questions and, eventually, sell and book things through voice controls. </p><p>Developers can seek approval for phrases that come after "Ok, Google" (the words that summon that Assistant) to launch the interactive bots. So, in the future if someone says, "Ok, Google, talk to Target," a chatbot for the retailer might appear and help the person buy things through a conversation, for example. They will even be able to choose among four different voices, two male and two female. </p><p>Jason Douglas, the Googler overseeing the new developer platform, compared it to applying for a web address in the early days of the internet. "This is the ability to immediately, on the fly -- instead of loading a site -- engage a user in a conversation," he said. "We&apos;re trying to make it as seamless and natural for users to go direct to developers." </p><p>Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc., are investing heavily in digital assistants that use artificial intelligence techniques to interact with humans more naturally. For Google, the investment is more crucial: Its Assistant is the strategic centerpiece of an effort to keep its lucrative web search business relevant in an age of mobile devices and wearable gadgets. Just like its search engine sent people to the right places on the web, the company&apos;s assistant should connect users to the most relevant and useful services. </p><p>The initiative is still in its infancy. Douglas said the company hasn&apos;t worked out how people will discover what phrases to utter to summon the correct chatbots. And a business model is likely years away. At first, the developer function will only work with Google Home, the company&apos;s new voice-activated speaker. It will come next to Google&apos;s Pixel smartphones and its messaging app Allo, and will soon add support for features like purchases and bookings, Google said, without specifying a date. The company has also said a richer software developer kit is coming for the service early next year.</p><p>Douglas stressed that the strategy for integrating services is different than standard operations for mobile apps and the desktop web. "It&apos;s a conversational experience," he said. "It&apos;s a pretty new ecosystem."</p><p>Not entirely new. Amazon has rolled out a similar feature with Alexa, its own virtual assistant, called skills, which links to external apps and services. Alexa works primarily with Amazon&apos;s Echo speakers, which compete with Google Home. Thus far, Amazon has created more than 5,000 skills with partners ranging from Domino&apos;s Pizza to ride-hailing service Uber. </p><p>Douglas said Google&apos;s Conversation Actions are different from Amazon&apos;s approach. Rather than picking and setting up skills manually, as Echo owners do, Google imagines its users conjuring any use case with a verbal command -- as long as a developer has built it and claimed the relevant phrase.</p><p>Alexa skills are "kind of like an installation," Douglas added. "With Google Home, you don&apos;t have to do anything prior."</p><p>Adding more functions to its Assistant is critical for Google&apos;s ability to broaden sales of Google Home, which had a warm reception from reviewers, but is two years behind Amazon&apos;s Echo. While Amazon has opened Echo to a range of other services, it has primarily used the device to drive purchases on Amazon.com. Those purchases come without web searches online. </p></div></div><div class="attachments"> </div>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

As more &#8220;things&#8221; become <a href="http://discover.sap.com/live-business/en-us/index.html/?campaigncode=CRM-XH16-SOC-RUNSMPLSOC&source=socialad-us-rs-DIGITALIST-Q2FY16">connected and aware</a>, governments can use analytics to add value for their citizens. We&#8217;ll take a look at some scenarios where the IoT can improve everyday life. But first, let&#8217;s look at how collaboration throughout an organization creates value.</p><h2><strong>How ecosystem networks and collaboration create value</strong></h2><p>The IoT works with sensor data in a wide range of fields. The technology helps get good data on how a connected device is working in various situations, and that data allows organizations to apply the insights they learn to their operations and processes. By analyzing automated sensor data from assets, organizations can make sure the delivery of critical services and the functionality of critical infrastructure are optimized.</p><p>Here are some scenarios where an IoT-based strategy could add value for governments and citizens.</p><h3><strong>1. Traffic control and parking</strong></h3><p>Why is it called rush hour when nobody goes anywhere fast? Good question. But with <a href="http://go.sap.com/docs/download/2015/06/be90664e-2f7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.pdf">digitized traffic control systems</a>, that may be changing. Most people are aware that GPS systems can provide multiple routes with suggestions based on traffic. Digitization of traffic controls uses input from traffic feeds, road construction, and road closures to reroute traffic for a shorter commute.</p><p>They can also adjust transit schedules to account for more accurate arrival and departure times. Cities are using GPS and sensors to update transit schedules to encourage the use of public transportation. Parking garages can monitor how many open spaces they have available, reducing time spent searching for a parking spot. In fact, some of these systems will interact with your car to direct you to an open space. Sensors built into bridges help cities prioritize replacement of aging bridges based on performance instead of a standard timetable.</p><h3><strong>2. Green living and sustainability</strong></h3><p>Another area where the IoT is impacting city life is sustainability. <a href="http://www.sustainable-chicago.com/2015/10/01/the-influence-of-iot-on-infrastructure/">Over half our planet&#8217;s population</a> now lives in urban areas. This creates ecological problems. Trimming excessive carbon emissions from transportation and higher energy use are a focus for governments worldwide. What are some examples? IoT-enabled assets can connect through the Internet to a utility, which can then optimize power use during non-peak demand times.</p><p>For example, the city of Chicago has deployed an array of sensors to track air quality and sidewalk traffic on a block-by-block basis. Glasgow is tracking crime and traffic issues to improve safety and congestion. The sensors also track noise and foot traffic to best determine areas that need improvement.</p><h3><strong>3. Smart cities</strong></h3><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://smartcitiescouncil.com/">new type of connected city</a> on the horizon. It&#8217;s a smart city. By definition, it&#8217;s a city that uses digital technologies to enhance quality of life in urban areas. This technology is being implemented not only in cities but also on many college campuses. In both cases, analytics from data sources can help deliver insights that can drive better decisions on policy, programs, and tactical needs.</p><p>So what cities are adding which features? We thought you&#8217;d never ask. Here are a few great examples. Los Angeles is adding responsive behavior to its traffic lights to reduce congestion. New York City is placing sensors to detect garbage amounts in bins so full bins are collected on time. Long Beach, California, has added smart meters to prevent illegal watering during times of drought. Boulder, Colorado, is implementing smart grids so consumers can look at their energy use in real time. Porto, Portugal, is installing Wi-Fi hotspots in the city&#8217;s 600 buses and taxis, creating the world&#8217;s largest Wi-Fi hot spot. Copenhagen uses IoT sensors in providing 20,000 LED street lights with renewable energy. Santander, Spain, uses over 12,000 sensors in refuse containers to cut their energy and waste management costs by 20-25%.</p><h2><strong>The future of the connected city</strong></h2><p>So what can we expect down the road? Many cities are developing mobile applications to help job seekers, tourists, and transit riders find the information they need quickly. Ports are being updated to provide superior infrastructure and supply chain operations. Big Data is providing simulation opportunities in emergency response, economic growth, and maintenance requirements. Public transportation loyalty programs in Montreal are now focusing on providing suitable entertainment opportunities.</p><p>Connecting networks creates serious data growth that requires a new platform to process it. Are you ready to bring your organization into the digital revolution with cross-agency and department data sharing that helps you reach better outcomes? What challenges do you see in the process?</p><h2>Regina Kunkle</h2><p> <img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/regina-kunkle.jpg" alt="" data-caption="" data-credit="" data-noderef="workspace://SpacesStore/c5aa5a72-032b-4210-9614-e1d116cc3dbf" /></p><h3>About Regina Kunkle</h3><p>Regina Kunkle is responsible for the State and Local/Higher Education (SLED), as sub-industry of the U.S. public sector industry, at SAP.

His response: It "makes a shitload more sense than Six Sigma did."</p><p>It was a telling quip. The popularization of Six Sigma -- a numbers-driven business-management strategy -- is one of the more enduring legacies of Immelt&apos;s predecessor, Jack Welch, a man whose shadow at times loomed large well after he was gone. But as Immelt completes his 15th year as CEO, it&apos;s his impact, not Welch&apos;s, that&apos;s in the spotlight. Will he be remembered for his plan to turn GE into a digital powerhouse -- the latest and perhaps boldest of his cultural and operating overhauls -- or for the laggard stock that&apos;s undermined his efforts?</p><p>Immelt&apos;s remodeling efforts were on full display at the December outlook event. This has largely been a story of simplification of late. The biggest example is the divestiture of the bulk of GE Capital, a lending and real estate behemoth largely built by Welch that nearly strangled the company during the financial crisis. Immelt&apos;s pruning efforts have also targeted legacy businesses (appliances), Welch&apos;s other efforts to diversify (insurance, NBC Universal) and even some divisions of his own making, exhibit A being the water unit GE recently put up for sale.</p><p>Immelt built the division through a series of acquisitions and the technologies are good, but trying to push a mishmash of chemical and membrane-based solutions through the same salesforce just didn&apos;t work, says RBC analyst Deane Dray. Much like the fire-alarm and security business Immelt cobbled together in the early 2000s, the water unit got lost in the giant company.   </p><p>GE had considered exiting it for awhile; it&apos;s now worried that antitrust regulators would take issue with the unit when reviewing the combination of its energy operations with Baker Hughes Inc. Dray says the water division should fetch around 12 times its 2016 Ebitda, or about $3.5 billion. The company paid an average of about 13 times Ebitda for its biggest water acquisitions, he estimates.</p><p>GE&apos;s CEO has drawn criticism for overpaying for deals that ultimately didn&apos;t pay off -- and a lot of his earlier acquisitions were expensive. He&apos;s sometimes been slower to act than investors would have liked, but at least Immelt has eventually been willing to admit when he&apos;s miscalculated and get out of businesses that don&apos;t fit. Not all CEOs have the awareness to do that. </p><p>The recently inked Baker Hughes agreement is also a backtracking of sorts from the billions of dollars of oil and gas acquisitions that came back to bite Immelt as prices plunged. The combination fills holes in GE&apos;s portfolio and is a smart bet that the future of oilfield services lies in data-driven efficiency. But structuring the deal as a partnership rather than an outright acquisition leaves the door open for an eventual spinoff of the "new Baker Hughes" and strikes me as a tacit acknowledgement of investors&apos; frustration with the pricey deals of the past.</p><p>With few portfolio changes left to make (GE is also selling its $3 billion-in-revenue electrical-distribution business), the focus turns to actually executing on that digital industrial identity that Immelt has been preaching about. He built up the industrial part with the $10.6 billion purchase of Alstom SA&apos;s power assets last year. A risky overture ridden with government hurdles, that takeover has blossomed into a victory with better synergies and earnings accretion than initially estimated.</p><p>On the digital side, GE agreed to buy two 3D printing companies this year for a combined $1.3 billion. Those didn&apos;t come cheap, but the opportunity is massive. GE has estimated it can sell $1 billion worth of additive metal manufacturing technology by 2020, while using the 3D printers to drive its own costs down by as much as $5 billion. Immelt is right; that investment does make a lot more sense than Six Sigma.</p><p>Investors are less sold on GE&apos;s Predix platform, an industrial-focused operating system akin to Android that the company wants to sell as a service to its peers. The idea is to plug data collected via sensors into applications that can help companies increase productivity. But the cost-cutting opportunities within GE are more tangible in the near term than the promised sales growth. Can GE really compete with the likes of Oracle Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc.? Maybe. </p><p>With industrial productivity gains slowing, digital efficiencies can make up the difference and Immelt deserves credit for being an early mover. At worst, he&apos;s set up GE to be a more profitable and competitive company, while discarding distracting and underperforming businesses. That&apos;s a pretty good legacy. The question is whether investors will in fact appreciate it while he&apos;s still in charge. Trotting out ambitious sales guidance two years in a row didn&apos;t do much to endear him. But if he can actually deliver, he may yet get GE&apos;s stock back to where it was in Welch&apos;s final days.</p><p>Only about $8 to go... </p><p class="news-disclaimer-text">This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Probably not. But the marketing pitches for many of Silicon Valley&#8217;s IoT technologies bear a certain resemblance to the medicine shows common in the United States&#8217; Old West.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Internet of Things is gaining traction in the industrial realm, the marketing pitch for IIoT naturally exaggerates the technology&#8217;s benefits while giving short shrift to the challenges of implementing it.</span></p><p><strong>Walking Before You Run (or Fly)</strong></p><p>The situation in China is similar to how it is in Silicon Valley. Many large enterprises here boast of having come up with perfect-sounding technologies for the industrial internet. And many of these vendors boldly state that buying their technology will enable industrial manufacturers &#8220;run faster and fly higher.&#8221;<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><em><strong><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.ioti.com/iot-strategy/lessons-china-internet-things">Lessons from China: Internet of Things</a></strong></strong></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes it sounds like industrial manufacturers are all healthy enough to &#8220;run.&#8221; There are more than a million industrial manufacturers in China. In today&#8217;s competitive marketplace, a relatively small number of industrial companies can thrive&#8212;whether it is in China or anywhere else in the world. Try to put yourself in the shoes of one of these companies. Let&#8217;s say it has low sales, lower profits, and fierce competition. On top of that, imagine that the business has a culture that is not conducive to innovation. A company like this would need to be able to metaphorically be able to stand up and walk before benefiting from an IoT technology. Asking a company like this &#8220;to run faster and fly higher&#8221; might sound like trying to get a hospital patient to run a marathon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the situation isn&#8217;t entirely different for companies that are competitive in their respective markets. For instance, our company Mixlinker Networks (Shenzhen) Inc. has a client that is a premium manufacturer of electricity generating equipment. This company operates 500&#8211;2000 KW stationary and mobile electricity generating units fueled by gasoline, diesel, natural gas, biogas, and coal-bed methane. The manufacturer has customers all over China and abroad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are their most urgent needs? Well, it&#8217;s not necessarily purchasing the supposedly latest and greatest smart-manufacturing technology. Their near-term priorities aren&#8217;t improving the efficiency of their automation, nor upgrading their products.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t a real advantage to industrial internet technology for companies like this. Instead, it means that the marketing message directed at companies like this doesn&#8217;t appreciate their key business challenges.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how can IIoT technology help a company like this? Well, it can help them answer many questions they don&#8217;t have answers for, and it can help them know more about their equipment once they leave the plant. Examples of such questions could include:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the equipment running normally? </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of malfunction are occurring over time and how are these problems addressed? </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are end users operating the equipment and how is incorrect operating behavior being addressed? </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What habits do operators have? Do they need further instructions on operating the equipment?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would temperature, humidity, or an unhealthy level of PM2.5 particulate air pollution affect how the plant operates? </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the characteristics of the life cycle of the equipment? What is the company doing to prolong the lifetime of components and how is it replacing part replacements?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of data is most valuable for assessing how factory equipment is running? </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of data would be needed to detect or prevent when equipment malfunctions? If the data suggests that a dangerous situation is imminent, can the equipment be turned off from remote?</span></li></ul><p>These are the types of questions that would be more important for industrial manufacturers than promises of &#8220;running faster and flying higher.&#8221; To be able to take full advantage of the IIoT, many companies would be well served to answer questions like the ones sooner rather than later. If they struggle to answer them, well, they should focus on metaphorically &#8220;standing up&#8221; before they attempt to &#8220;fly.&#8221;<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p><p><strong>One Size Does Not Always Fit All</strong></p><p>A single equipment manufacturer may produce dozens of products, and each of those products may have dozens of models. In the broader competitive landscape, there may be many companies that make the same type of equipment, and each of these enterprises may have an entirely different approach to product design. Complicating matters, each product generation may differ substantially from older products. Ultimately, there could easily be tens of thousands of equipment manufacturers with a variety of business and data needs.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the large degree of variability among manufacturers, the way each acquires data might be completely different. This variability is why, for many IT service vendors, they may have a good IoT solution for one manufacturer or for a particular piece of industrial equipment, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily work as well for other manufacturers or different types of equipment. Do we have a way to address the issue with the same methodology for all the completely different equipment?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Mixlinker Networks (Shenzhen) Inc., our approach is to acknowledge this variability and to develop IIoT systems that can be deployed across a range of industries for an array of different equipment types. Our systems are suited for devices ranging from boilers to construction machinery to PLC industrial controllers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, we recommend that your company be skeptical of companies that promise to help transform your business by simply purchasing their technology. While we are firm believers in the power of Industry 4.0, we counsel you to be pragmatic and to assess that your company&#8212;and all of its equipment&#8212;is fully in order before attempting to become an IIoT leader. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote in Thus Spoke Zarathustra: &#8220;He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying.&#8221;</span></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

It&apos;s showcasing the service with a closer partnership with LG Electronics Co. announced Sunday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where LG and a slew of hardware manufacturers aim to make a splash ahead of the iPhone&apos;s 10th anniversary later this year. </p><p>Until now, Google&apos;s Pixel smartphone, introduced in October, has been the only handset with the company&apos;s automated assistant. Gummi Hafsteinsson, the product lead for the assistant, said exclusivity was required to refine the system, a key priority at the company. "It was a new product and we wanted to make sure we took the baby steps required," he said. Investment bank Evercore ISI estimates that Mountain View, California-based Google shipped 552,000 Pixel phones in the fourth quarter last year in addition to 500,000 Google Home speakers, another device that already runs the assistant service, making the current accessibility to Google Assistant slim compared with competitors like Apple&apos;s Siri and Amazon.com Inc.&apos;s Alexa. </p><p>By adding the assistant to Android devices, which researcher IDC estimates make up 85 percent of all global smartphones, Google is moving closer to its goal of expanding the use of the feature. The virtual assistant will reach about one-third of Android phones, including the new devices rolled out Sunday by LG and others, that use Google&apos;s latest software, according to the company. </p><p> "We obviously would want to provide it to every device in the world," Hafsteinsson added.</p><p>Android phones that run Google&apos;s Play store services will now have access to the assistant, which can be summoned through a voice command ("OK, Google") or the phone&apos;s home screen. But Google is working more intimately with LG. </p><p>On Sunday in Barcelona, LG unveiled its latest phone, the G6, with the Google Assistant. It has super slim bezels on either side of the 5.7-inch display, putting a larger screen than that of the iPhone 7 Plus into a smaller package. The phone from the South Korean company has a dual-lens camera system and a high-resolution screen packed into a thin metal body. Those features put it on par with the latest pricier smartphones -- a competitive field that includes rising Chinese players, such as Huawei Technologies Co., and now Google. </p><p>LG worked closely with the Pixel maker to ensure that the South Korean company&apos;s own services, like its calendar and alarm clock apps, work easily with Google&apos;s assistant. Some of its Android peers, such as Samsung, are building their own voice-assistant services. Bloomberg News reported that Huawei is doing the same. </p><p>"We still keep a very close relationship between LG and Google, even though Google is building their own phone," said Ian Hwang, a product manager at LG. He called Google a "frenemy," but said the search giant cannot rely on its own Pixel phone as the world&apos;s only advanced Android hardware.LG had 3.7 percent of the global smartphone market as of the end of the 2016 third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The phones are going on sale ahead of an expected significant half of the year for the smartphone industry. Samsung Electronics Co. is prepping the latest release of its flagship Galaxy S line. Apple is getting ready for a new iPhone with a crisper OLED display and an embedded Home button with a glass back. Andy Rubin, the creator of Google&apos;s Android software, is working on his own smartphone hardware. With each device, the creators are focusing increasingly on artificial intelligence software to lock consumers into the companies&apos; systems. </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Instead, Uber agreed to dig deeper into its computer servers to look for the files that Waymo claims were stolen and the ride-hailing company&#8217;s lawyer said haven&#8217;t been found. Uber also agreed to interview employees to help find the files.</p><h3>Prosecution Fear</h3><p>Uber already has tested Alsup&#8217;s patience on the injunction when the judge learned Levandowski may not testify in the case by asserting his rights under the Constitution&#8217;s Fifth Amendment, protecting a person from self-incrimination. </p><p>Levandowski, who wasn&#8217;t named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has cited the possibility of a criminal case against him and urged the judge not to force Uber to turn over records to Waymo that might incriminate him.

Read on to learn how Tuzmukhamedov has personally helped reshape the city by leveraging hardware infrastructure, automation of municipal facilities, provisioning digital services, and citizen engagement.</p><p><strong>Could you briefly summarize where you are now with your smart city initiative?</strong></p><p><strong><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/eldar-46dddb50877f1401c8013b2f54f792ae.jpg" alt="" data-caption="" data-credit="" data-noderef="workspace://SpacesStore/9e91429c-9fd9-4b5e-b075-63a1ea24c592" />Tuzmukhamedov</strong>: We have already deployed several large-scale systems, which significantly increased the quality of life for Moscow citizens, bolstered efficiency of decision-making and competence of management, and drove budget savings. Smart City Lab, created in August 2016, is intended to search for innovations and apply new disruptive technology that will make our city better.</p><p>We are successfully employing IoT, big data, machine learning, augmented reality, virtual reality and other advanced technologies in our education, healthcare, transportation, and safety projects; and Smart City Lab acts as a center that synchronizes and coordinates all technology activities and ensures synergy.</p><p><strong>What do you think has been Moscow&apos;s biggest smart-city success to date?</strong></p><p><strong>Tuzmukhamedov</strong>: Our biggest success is the speed and the scale of deploying technology in the city. In 2011 we implemented large-scale automation in all areas of municipal facilities. All municipal clinics and schools in Moscow are fully automated; they have electronic document flow and automated budgeting, and provide online services to the citizens.</p><p>E-readiness of our citizens is another major success, with 98% broadband coverage, excellent 4G coverage and the city Wi-Fi system used by all citizens, from children to senior.</p><aside class="pullQuote">All of our city vehicles, including public transport and municipal vehicles, are now connected to a centralized platform that makes it possible to monitor their operation.</aside><p>Where other cities face problems with user engagement, we have great numbers due to the e-readiness of Moscow. 1.5 million use our voting app, 1 million use our city app to report problems, and half of the city regularly uses 200 electronic services, available across all channels: online, mobile apps, and via text messages and unstructured supplementary service data.</p><p><strong>Which are your favorite IoT implementations that are you oversee?</strong></p><p><strong>Tuzmukhamedov</strong>: All of our city vehicles, including public transport and municipal vehicles, are now connected to a centralized platform that makes it possible to monitor their operation.</p><p>All the municipal vehicles have GPS and GLONASS, speed and fuel consumption control, and soon we will have sensors installed that control the vehicle in performing their functions, like if a &apos;street flusher&apos; is flushing at the moment. Public transport is also equipped with sensors, and mobile operator data is used to analyze its speed and location, and optimize routes and schedules.</p><p>Another IoT platform of ours is the automatic metering system. More than 3500 municipal buildings are already connected and have automated water and power consumption metering and billing, and by 2020 every household in the city will enjoy the benefits of smart metering.</p><p><strong>What do you see as the defining characteristics of a smart city?</strong></p><p><strong>Tuzmukhamedov</strong>: The strategic tasks of a smart city are actually the same as those of a city in general. One: we need to create a comfortable environment for the citizens and the businesses; two: the authorities shall be efficient, take into account citizen opinions, make data-driven decisions and act fast; three: we need to create and maintain a powerful infrastructure.</p><p>&apos;Smart&apos; means that we use technology to complete these tasks, and Moscow is dealing with this just fine, as we have strong hardware infrastructure, large pools of data for decision-making and high level of citizen engagement.</p><p><strong>Which city do you think is the "smartest" in the world? </strong></p><p><strong>Tuzmukhamedov</strong>: We keep a close eye on the achievements of many smart cities, so I have to say that I cannot pick one and pronounce it the smartest. The conditions and needs of every city vary greatly; they have different climates, populations, migration levels, ecology problems, public transportation systems, and so forth.</p><p>We also need to keep in mind that the concepts and notions used by smart city associations are not yet unified, as it is hard to bring &apos;smart&apos; to a common standard. However, as I said, we are closely monitoring all the achievements, always looking for something that we can successfully use in Moscow.</p><p><strong>What roles do you think public and private sectors should play as a smart city is developed?</strong></p><p><strong>Tuzmukhamedov</strong>: Smart cities must be a public-private partnership, and Moscow&apos;s experience is remarkable proof of this statement. The city shall not just spend its budget; it shall always aim to attract investment. Moscow uses investment contracts, creating and offering new models for the business.</p><p>Our free city Wi-Fi is built on investment model: the companies spend their money on the infrastructure, and then make profit on advertisement. The same goes for the city CCTV system: the cameras are installed and maintained by mobile operators. It is a mutually beneficial cooperation, where we cut our expenses, and the business gets its profit.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

In TV spots that aired nationally on Wednesday, a Burger King employee asked, &#8220;OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?&#8221; and the phrase acted as a trigger for the device, until Google took steps to disable the command on Wednesday.</p><p>Lawyers and regulators say the stunt, although it may be an effective piece of advertising, could put both the burger chain and Google at risk of legal recourse and consumer backlash.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable for Google not to have appropriate mechanisms in place so that the device couldn&#8217;t be activated by a third party,&#8221; said intellectual property lawyer Faith D. Kasparian, from Morse, Barnes-Brown & Pendleton. &#8220;On the part of Burger King, I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re thinking. A reasonable person would probably not expect that a third party could activate a device like this in their home.&#8221;</p><p>The FTC could have a claim against Google for the spot, on the grounds that consumers didn&#8217;t receive adequate disclosures, Kasparian said. Google has &#8220;a history with the FTC,&#8221; she said, with several consent orders issued against the company. Google could also take legal action against Burger King for &#8220;inappropriately leveraging that device,&#8221; Kasparian added.</p><p>"FTC investigations are non-public, and we do not comment on an investigation or the existence of an investigation," Juliana Gruenwald Henderson, a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission, said in an emailed statement.</p><p>Google declined to comment.</p><p>Google Home does not distinguish between different voices speaking in its proximity. This means the device will obey any voice it hears, whether it originates from its owner or an opportunistic television commercial.

Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.&#8217;s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there&#8217;s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway.</p><p>If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can&#8217;t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas -- and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day.</p><p>&#8220;Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,&#8221; said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. &#8220;With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.&#8221;</p><p>As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that&#8217;s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error.</p><p>Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that&#8217;s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector.</p><p>The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren&#8217;t crucial components.)</p><p>The idea isn&#8217;t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game &#8220;is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,&#8221; said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team.</p><p>Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What&#8217;s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation.</p><p><strong>Quick Brown Fox</strong><br />Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn&#8217;t responded properly, &#8220;we&#8217;re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,&#8221; Waymo said in a self-driving project report. &#8220;If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.&#8221;</p><p>At Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to &#8220;break the system&#8221; through what&#8217;s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions.</p><p>For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That&#8217;s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer.</p><p>A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written.</p><p>Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should &#8220;be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,&#8221; with follow-up validation.

But sweeping changes are coming to the supply chain, says Paul Richardson, chief innovation officer at DHL Supply Chain and <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/iot-world-europe/?utm_source=iotworldnews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=iotworldeurope-TEC6237&utm_term=article&utm_content=DHL">Internet of Things World Europe</a> keynote speaker. In a recent interview, Richardson filled us in on how DHL is using Internet of Things technology and how they plan to use the technology in the future.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us more about your role?</strong></p><p><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/paul%20richardson_0.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="409" data-caption="" data-credit="" data-noderef="workspace://SpacesStore/ba64dc58-9459-4793-8c5e-d794f489cc3e" /></p><p><strong>Richardson: </strong>I am the chief innovation officer in the UK and Ireland Supply Chain division, and have responsibility for identifying new ways to add value to our clients and to the DHL business. This involves engaging with external partners, as part of our open-innovation approach, and developing new businesses with innovative business models.</p><p>I also have a responsibility for four sectors, passenger gateway, technology, public sector, and Envirosolutions, which provides direct access to clients and accelerates the delivery of change.</p><p><strong>Would you say there&apos;s been a surprising lack of good industrial IoT case studies to date?</strong></p><p><strong>Richardson: </strong>There is certainly a high level of activity relating to Internet of Things, both in DHL itself and with our clients. However, there are a few factors that have resulted in the relative lack of industrial case studies.</p><p>Firstly, we are now approaching the tail end of <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3412017">Gartner&#8217;s Hype Cycle</a> when it comes to IoT. That is, we are at a point where the news stories and hype around IoT is starting to reduce, and the delivery of IoT projects is beginning to increase.</p><p>Secondly, the nature of IoT is that many projects are bottom-up and tackle specific solutions. In contrast to more top-down trends, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) from a few years ago, examples of IoT are more granular.</p><p>Finally, as some of the IoT projects that we are working on deliver significant competitive advantage to our clients, we need to keep confidentiality on the new ways of working.</p><p>Given the number of projects that I know are taking place, I suspect that you&#8217;ll see an increasing number of case studies coming out in 2017 and 2018. In particular, we&#8217;ll see more IoT case studies that link to machine learning.</p><p><strong>Who will drive this surge in machine learning?</strong> </p><p><strong>Richardson: </strong>There are a number of different providers currently contributing to the "IoT solution stack." These providers service various aspects of a business bringing IoT solutions to areas such as sensors, communications, device management, data aggregation, security, and analysis. Such solutions need to be tailored and adapted for the requirements of different sectors, such as retail, automotive or FMCG, rather than being "one size fits all."</p><p>We expect that the leaders in IoT will be those providers who can uncover the real business opportunities, understand the challenges of working in each sector, and who have the rigor of delivering technology enabled solutions. Given that DHL is one of these organizations, you could argue that I&#8217;m subjective on this topic! We are, however, delivering a broad range of initiatives right now and I see that trend continuing. </p><p><strong>How will DHL apply IoT technology in the supply chains?</strong></p><p><strong>Richardson: </strong>IoT in supply chains opens a realm of opportunities. At its simplest, it&#8217;s about understanding where inventory is in the supply chain, particularly when it&#8217;s not in a warehouse, and what state that inventory is in, for example, its temperature.</p><p>From there, and with the use of machine learning and analytics, companies can do more granular planning, procurement, and production, and can consider how to deliver more segmented supply chain solutions. Beyond this, the ability to tag and track an item allows for more mechanization to take place in the supply chain, providing lower costs to serve and extending potential service levels.</p><p>Within ten years, we&#8217;ll see a significant proportion of the inventory in the supply chain with sensors collecting data. The winners in the space will be those that can aggregate, extend, and then analyze the data to adapt the supply chains in real time.</p><p><strong>How does artificial intelligence fit into DHL&apos;s future plans?</strong></p><p><strong>Richardson: </strong>AI will have a significant influence on the supply chain, and is already very much part of what we do. While there hasn&#8217;t been a huge amount of hype surrounding AI in supply chains, there are clear examples when you break it down into its key component parts. These include predictive analytics, scheduling and resource planning, operational efficiency, customer insight, and automation and robotics.</p><p>AI is, in essence, the combination of data collected through IoT sensors combined with machine learning. This is set to drive the most significant changes, which will fundamentally reduce costs and improve services for end customers.</p><p><strong>What is holding back the technological development of supply chains?</strong></p><p><strong>Richardson: </strong>The whole process of digitalization, of which the introduction of IoT is just a part, is still at a very early stage across the industry.</p><p>The constraints are not with companies, or types of companies, but with the availability of talent that can rethink businesses with an IoT perspective, and with pragmatism and experience that can then enable the required changes to happen.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Waymo has already tested these vehicles, plus other makes and models, on public roads, but only with its employees and contractors inside. By opening the doors to the general public with a larger fleet, the company will get data on how people experience and use self-driving cars -- and clues on ways to generate revenue from the technology. </p><p>"We&apos;re at the point when it&apos;s really important to find how real people, outside the Google environment, will use this technology," said John Krafcik, Waymo&apos;s chief executive officer. "Our goal is that they will use this for all their transportation needs."</p><p>Waymo is letting people across parts of the Phoenix metropolitan area apply for the service as part of an "early rider program." Initial users will be able to book Waymo&apos;s minivans using an app, but won&apos;t have to pay. Dollars will flow eventually, Krafcik said, yet he declined to share details. The company is signing up hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs. </p><p>Google is a pioneer in autonomous cars, launching its research program in 2009. After mostly ignoring the project for several years, the auto industry has recently rushed to catch up, pumping billions of dollars into similar technology and engineering talent. A bevy of newcomers have joined too, including some founded by former Waymo engineers, making the field incredibly competitive before anyone has made money. "We expect today&#8217;s announcement to be just one of a series of technological, strategic and commercial initiatives by Alphabet to position Waymo as a strong competitor to established ride sharing firms," Adam Jonas and other analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. </p><p>Uber Technologies Inc. has emerged as a particularly bitter rival. Last year, autonomous vehicles run by the ride-hailing giant began picking up paying customers in Pittsburgh. Earlier this year, it started doing the same in Tempe, a town in the eastern part of the Phoenix metro area. (Waymo is currently suing Uber over the technology.) Yet Waymo insists its business model will be broader than Uber&apos;s.</p><p>"Yes, self-driving technology makes sense for ride-sharing," said Krafcik, a former executive at Hyundai Motor Co.&apos;s U.S. operations and Ford Motor Co. "It also makes sense for personal car ownership." Transportation to and from transit hubs and logistics also made his list. In Phoenix, Krafcik said participants will use the autonomous minivan fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area twice the size of San Francisco.</p><p>Last year, Waymo inked a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV for 100 Pacifica vans outfitted with Waymo&apos;s software and tailored hardware. Waymo added the fleet to the to 70 other cars it is testing in California, Texas, Washington and Arizona, which it entered in 2016. Since Google started its program, those vehicles have racked up nearly 3 million test miles on public roads, primarily to refine the autonomous software and ensure the system could handle rare but potentially dangerous edge cases. Waymo has faced criticism for not launching a commercial service sooner. This was especially true last year when it lost several top engineers, and Uber launched its limited test service. Krafcik has often responded by pointing to safety concerns and technical obstacles to deploying fully driverless cars. </p><p>The Phoenix service answers some of these concerns. It&apos;s a clear move beyond the research phase that focuses on passenger experience and business model development. Waymo&apos;s staff has worked on new displays and controls to get people comfortable being inside self-driving cars. The Phoenix passengers will be the first to see these tools in action.</p><p>"This move is likely meant to make up for Alphabet&#8217;s significant disadvantages in automated vehicle miles/data harvesting," the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. "The quest for dominance (or relevance?) in autonomous cars hinges upon harvesting and analyzing hundreds of billions of miles of real-world driving."</p><p>Waymo&apos;s almost 3 million miles are high quality, but the quantity pales in comparison to Uber with more than 100 million total miles per day, Tesla Inc.&#8217;s electric fleet at over 5 million miles per day, and Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s global vehicle fleet, which covers about 2.7 billion miles a day, they noted.</p><p>Waymo is still moving cautiously. Chosen users for the Phoenix service will sit in passenger seats, and Waymo will put contractor or employee testers in the driver seat -- although Krafcik said the goal is to remove them eventually.</p><p>The company has quietly been testing the service with a handful of Phoenix residents for two months. From those trials, he noted one behavior trait when no one has to drive. "People have a better opportunity to bond and connect inside the vehicle," he said. </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

That&#8217;s not how it will go down. The future of artificial intelligence will be much more banal, even downright sad.</p><p>Human fantasies about robots stem from the common misconception that they are working for &#8220;truth&#8221; or some kind of scientific objectivity -- or at least that they have an allegiance to some kind of abstract third party. From there, it&#8217;s not too much of a stretch to imagine their allegiance shifting to themselves, or at least against humans.</p><p>The reality is very different. Artificial intelligence is a tool, often a weapon, that&#8217;s aimed at certain people and controlled by others. A rifle would be a reasonable metaphor: It can be used to keep the peace or to repress, but in any case it&#8217;s pointed by someone at someone else. The biggest difference is the scale. An algorithm can be manufactured once, inside a data science lab, and then unleashed on billions of people simultaneously.</p><p>The marketing of artificial intelligence tends to obscure its nature. Whether they are used to select news articles, target advertising or identify potential criminals, algorithms are portrayed as tools of objectivity, aimed at nobody in particular and controlled by nobody in particular. The faces of the rifle owners tend to be hidden -- often by design. If we saw them clearly, we might not like the view.</p><p>The good news is that we need not fear the robot apocalypse as commonly conceived. People won&#8217;t build robots capable of turning on their owners, just as they wouldn&#8217;t design a rifle with a barrel trained on the person firing it. People don&#8217;t surrender power voluntarily. Rather, they try to camouflage power as benign.</p><p>The bad news is that these weapons are mighty indeed, with the power to devastate peoples&#8217; lives in ways that range from branding them as crime risks to taking away their children. Once they are squarely aimed at the public, we might not be able to tell the difference between reality and the apocalypse. If we wind up wearing subcutaneous chips that auto-complete our thoughts while we compete for the last remaining jobs, we might have to admit that, singularity or not, we have become the servants of our robot overlords.</p><p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that some of the biggest promoters of the singularity live and work in Silicon Valley.

It relies on three funnels of information: ranger radios, animal tracker tags, and a variety of environmental sensors such as camera traps and satellites. This being the product of the world&#8217;s 10th-richest software developer, it sends everything back to a centralized computer system, which projects specific threats onto a map of the monitored region, displayed on large screens in a closed circuit-like security room.</p><p>For instance, if a poacher were to break through a geofence sensor set up by a ranger in a highly-trafficked corridor, an icon of a rifle would flag the threat as well as any micro-chipped elephants and radio-carrying rangers in the vicinity.</p><p>Think of DAS as similar to a comprehensive camera system in Vegas casinos, with park managers replacing pit bosses on the hunt for cheats and camo-sporting rangers in place of the security guards that flank blackjack tables. Except in this case, when alerts strike, managers aren&#8217;t preventing the hemorrhage of a couple hundred thousand dollars; they&#8217;re dispatching help to save one of 352,271 estimated remaining elephants, or one of 30,000 surviving rhinoceroses.</p><p>&#8220;By nature, I am attracted to tough problems&#8212;problems that, by definition, require innovative and dramatic solutions,&#8221; said Allen from his office in Seattle, where his philanthropic company, Vulcan Inc., is based. &#8220;[The DAS project] is the ideal combination of two of my interests&#8212;technology and the preservation of [the savannah elephant,] one of Africa&#8217;s most iconic species.&#8221;</p><p><strong>High-Profile Partners</strong></p><p>DAS was first put into the wild in October 2016, when Ted Schmitt, lead program manager at Vulcan, and his team deployed the technology at the Lewa Conservancy, a 55,000-acre preserve in Kenya. Then it was brought to Odzala National Park, founded in 1935 and one of Africa&#8217;s oldest national parks in the Republic of Congo. Six other African conservation sites in partnership with Save the Elephants, African Parks Network, and Wildlife Conservation Society soon followed.</p><p>But its most high-profile partner is Singita, the network of standard-setting luxury safari lodges run by conservation guru Luke Bailes. If DAS is the un-sexiest player in this space, Singita is the very sexiest&#8212;it has 12 properites spread across Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and South Africa&#8212;and the lodges have the most sumptuous design, the largest wine collection, and often the highest price tag among its competitive set.</p><p>DAS was installed at the five-lodge Singita Grumeti reserve in March, using sensors to illuminate a key corridor for poachers intent on crossing to the neighboring Serengeti. Bailes calls the system a &#8220;revelation and a game-changer.&#8221; He said the &#8220;layered approach of technology and boots on the ground enables Singita Grumeti to significantly enhance its effectiveness in dealing with poaching.&#8221;</p><p>Part of the success is Vulcan&#8217;s holistic approach: Schmitt&#8217;s team developed the software and provided capital for equipment and  hardware, and they&#8217;ve also invested in training, technical input, support, setup, mentoring, and guidance. Though the partnership is just two months old, &#8220;the impact has been significant,&#8221; Bailes said.</p><p><strong>The Elephant in the Room</strong></p><p>According to Schmitt, DAS happened almost by accident. In January 2014, the Vulcan team had been dispatched to Kasane, Botswana, to help kick off the first pan-African elephant census in more than 40 years. &#8220;We had all of the best and most famous scientists that do wildlife research and census-taking come together, trying to address a common problem.&#8221;</p><p>The issue: how to survey hundreds of thousands of square miles in order to get an accurate idea as to how many elephants are still living and how many have died? Ultimately, the group decided to systematically fly in grid-like patterns over 17 African countries, carefully threading and weaving above the continent, photographing herds and carcasses, and counting the old-fashioned way.</p><p>There was talk of using drones, but the area&#8217;s scope was too large for the battery-powered devices, and researchers feared the technology wasn&#8217;t consistent enough. The situation was too urgent for any technological mishaps, Schmitt said.</p><p>In the end, his team came away with two major insights. First, the population of savannah elephants has declined by 30 percent in the last seven years, primarily due to ivory poaching. Second, having tons of data on elephant poaching is useless unless conservationists can make sense of it in real time. It&#8217;s precisely the type of nut that Schmitt and Allen live to crack.</p><p><strong>Software Saves the Day</strong></p><p>Schmitt&#8217;s first instinct was to harness as much data as possible, casting a wide net across the African savannah. &#8220;But what a lot of [park managers] were telling us was that they were already overwhelmed by the information they had. They couldn&#8217;t use it effectively.&#8221; What they needed was a way to aggregate and visualize data. They needed software.</p><p>&#8220;All of the tools that are out there are designed for the military,&#8221; Schmitt said. &#8220;They&#8217;re very expensive, for highly trained individuals, and not suited to the wildlife and conservation domains.&#8221; Rangers were instead using a decades-old system. </p><p>Building DAS took about 12 months and the partnership of many on-the-ground organizations who gave feedback. Threats differ by location, it turns out: In Tanzania, wildlife snares and bush-meat hunters are a big problem, while ivory poaching is a more common issue in Kenya. Then there are less malicious issues, such as bush fires, or a cow that has wandered from a local farm to big game predators.  </p><p>Schmitt and his team designed a system capable of recognizing all these factors. Some can be reported by rangers over radio; others can be picked up by seismic sensors, satellites, drones, camera traps, and speed detectors. </p><p>&#8220;With every type of enforcement, the most urgent task is figuring out where the bad guys are,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;You might have the best people and equipment money can buy, but unless you know where to direct your response, you&#8217;re essentially powerless. The intel this system provides will help conservancies use their limited resources much more effectively.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Early Results and Next Steps</strong></p><p>It will take two to five years to get real measurements from conservationists, but the feedback for DAS has been promising already. Though no animals have yet been saved as a direct result of DAS, rangers in two separate cases were able to use DAS alerts to intercept poachers who had already made a kill. </p><p>Poachers are not the only significant threat to wildlife in Africa. The system has helped rangers in Kenya prevent human-wildlife conflict by spelling out which farms&#8217; cattle are most likely to roam into conservation areas. By working with locals to rein in the livestock, rangers can prevent retaliatory killings by farmers that happen when, say, a lion preys on that wandering cow.</p><p>Bailes&#8217;s Singita is just one glowing report card of several. &#8220;The area managers we&#8217;ve been working with feel that this is a game-changer,&#8221; Schmitt said. &#8220;They know they&#8217;ve needed something like this. And they&#8217;re pretty no-nonsense&#8212;they&#8217;ll kick something out quickly if it&#8217;s not useful.&#8221; </p><p>What&#8217;s been surprising to the Vulcan team is how DAS has unified conservationists who had previously been focused only on their individual reserves. &#8220;All of these groups are now sharing best practices with each other, more now than they ever had been. They&#8217;d all been doing the best they can in their regions, but stepping back and exchanging information has proved to have tremendous value in itself,&#8221; said Schmitt.</p><p>The next hurdle is bringing connectivity to places that still don&#8217;t have it, such as the jungles and forests of Congo. Enhancing connectivity where it exists but is low will also be key; it&#8217;s what will allow DAS to show alerts in real-time (rather than on a delay). Then, Schmitt said, comes the exciting part: &#8220;Once you have more and better data, you get to this place where we have real expertise. Where you can ask, &#8216;How do you analyze data and call up patterns and proactively identify threats?&#8217;&#8221; If Big Data is step one, machine learning is the very big step two.</p><p>For his part, Allen is happy to let his team run wild. &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent time with these park rangers, so I&#8217;m familiar with how difficult their work is. Providing this kind of tool to help them defend endangered species is incredibly fulfilling.&#8221;</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Scrutinize the 400+ speakers featured on the conference agenda all you like - you&apos;re unlikely to find a greater advocate for prioritizing VR and AR in the IoT space.</p><h2>The rise of virtual reality banking</h2><p>Due to the similar nature of the technologies, VR and AR tend to be lumped together as one category. "But to my mind, these are very distinct environments," Wyper says.</p><p>He begins by describing how Mastercard sees virtual reality being used in the payments space:</p><p>"We look beyond the payment component, on to the broader commerce experience. The way that people will be paying is one element, but we also look at the steps that exist before and after the payments - things like loyalty, offers and fulfilment."</p><p>Banks and retailers are especially keen to secure the new and retained business that could be unlocked by a VR-enabled user experience, affording customers all of the benefits of being in store (or branch) without having to leave their homes - and they see Mastercard as a prime candidate to fulfil this vision for them.</p><p>"We&apos;re interested in replicating a physical world experience entirely through a digital platform," Wyper tells me. "The idea is, how do I take a brick-and-mortar store, then enable a consumer to be immersed in that environment through VR so they can access different products and services."</p><p>Many businesses are infatuated with this idea because they see the mass-adoption of VR technology among consumers as an inevitability, sooner or later.</p><p>"The cost of the hardware is dropping, driven by the likes of Samsung, where the hardware is getting much cheaper from a price-point perspective. VR hardware will eventually become widely available to consumers," Wyper agrees.</p><p>"Subsequently, when you look at the evolution in the processing power of those hardware devices, that will improve the actual experience a consumer would go through."</p><p>The end result of these advancements will be "more fluid, interactive VR environments", which is reassuring - it&apos;s difficult to imagine feeling comfortable using VR to transfer money and make payments as the technology currently stands.</p><h2>Augmented reality to nudge customers in the right direction</h2><p>According to Wyper, the key difference of augmented reality from Mastercard&apos;s perspective is that "AR allows consumers to have a different kind of experience when they&apos;re actually in a physical environment".</p><p>So, he asks, how do you overlay a digital lens to that experience?</p><p>"Again, we&apos;re still at a relatively early stage from a consumer adoption perspective," Wyper says. "That&apos;s despite the mass take-up we saw with Pokémon Go and other similar phenomena. In general, consumers are still testing and understanding what this experience can offer them."</p><p>While VR can offer a perfected in-store experience from a remote location, AR stands to transform the customer&apos;s experience when actually in a store - and this technology&apos;s impact is much closer to being realized.</p><p>"Encouraging a consumer to move to certain parts of a store, where there are certain offers or products that the retailer wants to make them aware of", is one game-changing application of AR that Mastercard is looking at, Wyper explains.</p><p>They&apos;re also interested in AR as means of gamification, where customers can unlock exclusive benefits or gain some sort of value from visiting certain brands, or stores in particular locations at certain times.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s no steadfast date yet on when these VR and AR technologies will see the light of day.</p><p>"One of the hardest challenges is trying to anticipate what&apos;s really going to take off, what will resonate, and the timing involved," Wyper admits.</p><h2>Never sacrifice security for innovation&apos;s sake</h2><p>The ambitious plans that Wyper is proposing for these technologies that Wyper is proposing may make some security specialists quake in their boots, particularly where virtual reality is concerned. Virtual banking environments could mean many additional technological layers where security flaws might be overlooked and exposed, at a time when user vulnerability could have the direst consequences.</p><p>"We&apos;ll never sacrifice security for the sake of an innovation," Wyper assures me. "What we&apos;ve done as a company is ensure that, for all these evolutions to the commerce experience, we&apos;re also continuing to involve and enhance the security of every single transaction. These two things have to go hand in hand."</p><p>Biometric identification and facial recognition are just two cybersecurity technologies that Mastercard is developing, where the widespread use of VR or AR would actually make their use even more applicable.</p><p>The Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) is another example. It&apos;s a solution that protects a cardholder&apos;s data when making digital payments, that&apos;s already used by the likes of Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.</p><h2>A Mastercard partnering masterclass</h2><p>Along with developing Mastercard&apos;s reach into IoT, VR and AR tech, Wyper is responsible for building the partnerships that will make this reach sustainable. This relates back to Wyper&apos;s previous role within Mastercard, where he spent three and a half years overseeing all of the company&apos;s startup activities, involving over 120 up-and-coming companies.</p><p>Partnerships with both startups (including <a href="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-makes-commerce-more-conversational-with-launch-of-chatbots-for-banks-and-merchants/" target="_blank">work with Kasisto</a> on AI-enabled chatbot platforms) and companies with a more established presence (see their <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/mastercard-partners-with-ibm-gm-on-connected-car-2016-10?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">work with IBM</a> on connected car solutions) will be key as Mastercard furthers its work in VR and AR, which could be integral to the four main environments they&apos;re working on: home, work, retail and car.</p><p>"We look at each of those different components and discover the needs and pain-points for each," Wyper explains. "Like what is it a car manufacturing might see that others don&apos;t which a connected device might solve, and how Mastercard can help to solve that issue.</p><p>"We can&apos;t do that just by ourselves, so partnerships are a core principle of how we go to market."</p><p>More details on Mastercard&apos;s plans with IoT, VR and AR, along with which partnerships will be crucial to the fulfilment of these strategies, will be shared at Internet of Things World 2017 this May.</p><p>&#8212; Jeremy Coward, Community Manager, IoT World News</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

After reviewing it, we realized that it contains a wealth of critical information for Industrial IoT implementation. I also had the chance to spend about an hour on the phone with Rajive Joshi, co-chair of the IIC Connectivity Task Group and one of the authors of the Connectivity Framework, asking questions and clarifying multiple points in the document.</p><p>Our conclusion is that the Connectivity Framework is a valuable way to assess Industrial IoT technologies and protocols and represents a great leap forward towards a common framework. This offers significant benefits for multiple parties, including:</p><ul><li>for those responsible for implementing industrial automation solutions &#8211; especially in manufacturing, utilities, healthcare, smart cities and other industry verticals where capturing and sharing data is still a major challenge</li><li>for technology companies serving the above industry verticals interested in both securing lasting value and expanding their offering</li><li>for standards defining organizations (SDOs), working on industrial IoT standards.</li></ul><p>The companies that actively contributed to the document were RTI, Cisco, Ericsson, Nokia &#8211; plus Itron, Kepware, Fujitsu, Samsung, AT&T, SAP, ABB, GE &#8211; just to name a few. Notably, we did not see many semiconductor players participate in this effort.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to do justice to the document in this post. We decided it would be critical to try to digest the 129 pages down to the most essential elements and provide our summary as to why we believe this document is so critical and what needs to be done next.</p><p>Currently, the Industrial IoT space &#8211; from manufacturing to utilities to healthcare and so on &#8211; reminds us of the Tower of Babel and the confusion of languages: currently there are multiple systems, very often proprietary and siloed, speaking different protocols unable to communicate with each other.</p><p>In manufacturing alone we have OPC-UA, Modbus, Profinet, DDS, Web Services with RESTful APIs and many others, some much more open than others. There are multiple connectivity standards and options, which creates a nightmare for business & technology executives alike in charge of implementing IoT solutions. This is one of the key technology impediments slowing down roll out of IoT systems.</p><p>We can&#8217;t expect industries to converge on a single connectivity format or a single protocol &#8211; it would be unrealistic and impractical. However, having a common framework which multiple industrial players can agree on can make these multiple connectivity technologies and protocols interoperable and easier to manage.</p><p>For connectivity specifically, we still often use either the OSI 7 layer model, originally published in 1984, or the Internet 4 layer framework. Both of these models were primarily designed for networks of people, not necessarily things, and both are outdated when it comes to Industrial IoT &#8211; as the whole approach to data and applications in IoT has grown much more complex in the past decade.</p><p>Not only do we care more about data, but also about data in specific user contexts. Data needs to be discovered, published, subscribed to, requested and replied to; exceptions need to be handled in a consistent manner &#8211; as more data functions get added over time, and the model needs to be flexible enough to accommodate the new functionality. The IIC&#8217;s attempt to define a much better suited framework that addresses data in motion is admirable.</p><p>The approach proposed in the Connectivity Framework allows treating multiple verticals and their technology stack in a similar and consistent fashion. It empowers the industrial users of IoT connectivity to clearly compare various connectivity technologies along a consistent set of criteria as to how well they address quality of service, and ask more specific questions about their architecture and to what extent it is future proof.</p><p>The criteria cover both functional and non-functional requirements of connectivity, such as: performance, scalability, reliability, resilience, security and safety &#8211; to name a few &#8211; in much detail. It creates an assessment template for connectivity solutions and platforms, providing a tool to compare "apples to apples" and discover early if problems may arise when implementing a particular solution.</p><p>When it comes to data interoperability, the Connectivity Framework does not stop short there &#8211; another very important point of the Framework addresses common data format and structure (a.k.a. syntactic interoperability) &#8211; making sure data flow is consistent and eliminating data errors along the way.</p><p>Data structure interoperability (syntactic interoperability) is a critical pre-requisite for the interoperability of meta-data, assigning meaning to data (a.k.a. semantic interoperability), which is a critical element for the seamless communication among industrial machines and with other services. The Framework opens the possibility for the industry to further collaborate on semantic interoperability.</p><p>The Connectivity Framework also opens up a marketplace for connectivity gateways, creating more choices for developers. Connectivity gateways put themselves between domain specific connectivity technologies (sometimes a de-facto domain connectivity standard) and core connectivity standards, allowing the data to flow seamlessly and in a consistent manner between the domain specific environment and a standardized network.</p><p>While the Connectivity Framework does not define standards in and of itself, it lays the foundation for SDOs (Standard Defining Organizations, such as the ISO and more specialized industry-specific standards organizations) to work on defining industrial IoT standards for multiple verticals to utilize a common framework.</p><p>In summary, the Connectivity Framework at a very minimum forms the basis for those responsible for selecting IoT platforms to compare multiple solutions in a consistent way and determine the gaps; it allows IoT technology developers and system architects to map their technology stack against similar solutions in the industry in a more "apples-to-apples" fashion; it offers the industry an opportunity to converge on vertical applications and data interoperability; and finally, it lays a foundation for SDOs, making standardization efforts much easier.</p><p>As for the future of the Connectivity Framework, the collaboration and support of the major IIC stakeholders should give it great momentum to get implemented. Many aspects of it will take years to develop and populate; however, the document itself will propel the industry forward by a few years &#8211; saving a lot of time in building consensus.</p><p>&#8212; Daniel Obodovski, Founder & CEO, The Silent Intelligence</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

But if all goes as planned, it&apos;s actually the future of shipping.</p><p>Last week, Kongsberg Gruppen ASA, a Norwegian maritime-technology firm, and Yara ASA, a fertilizer manufacturer, announced a partnership to build the world&apos;s first fully autonomous cargo containership. Manned voyages will start in 2018, and in 2020 the Yara Birkeland will set sail all on its own. It&apos;s the beginning of a revolution that should transform one of the world&apos;s oldest and most conservative industries -- and make global shipping safer, faster and cleaner than it&apos;s ever been.</p><p>The commercial rationale for autonomous ships has long been clear. The U.S. Coast Guard has estimated that human error accounts for up to 96 percent of all marine casualties. A recent surge in piracy is a grim reminder that crews remain vulnerable (and valuable) targets for international criminals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the industry is facing a chronic shortage of skilled workers who want a career at sea.</p><p>By one consultant&apos;s estimate, moreover, carrying sailors accounts for 44 percent of a ship&apos;s costs. That&apos;s not just salaries: crew quarters, air-conditioning units, a bridge (which typically requires heavy ballast to ensure a ship&apos;s balance) and other amenities take up valuable weight and space that might otherwise be used for cargo. And that dead weight contributes to a bigger problem: Maritime shipping accounts for about 2.5 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Barring a radical change, those emissions are set to surge in the decades ahead.</p><p>All this explains why eliminating a crew and its costs has been a long-time goal for companies and governments around the world. The most advanced effort so far has come from Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which rolled out a virtual-reality prototype of an autonomous ship in 2014. According to the company, the ship will be 5 percent lighter, and burn up to 15 percent less fuel, than a comparable vessel with humans aboard. </p><p>That effort has been the subject of considerable skepticism -- especially from seafarer unions who doubt that technology can replace experienced sailors, and note that the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency that oversees shipping, prohibits crewless operations. But what seemed impossible three years ago is quickly becoming reality. Most of the sensor technology for autonomous ships is now commercially available, and crucial collision-avoidance tools have been around in various forms since the early 1990s.</p><p>The Yara Birkeland is a modest but important step forward. Although it can be operated remotely by a pilot, it will also be able to cruise on its own, using an array of sensors, cameras and navigation tools, all guided by sophisticated algorithms. Back on shore, an operations center will monitor its progress.</p><p>When it launches next year, with a fully electric power plant, the ship will transport fertilizer from Yara&apos;s factory to ports about 16 miles away, thereby replacing 40,000 shipments a year that had once been carried by polluting diesel trucks. That short route will give the ship&apos;s owners -- along with regulators and other autonomous shipping aspirants -- a first chance to see such a vessel in operation.</p><p>Such trips may soon become routine. Norway has designated the waters off of Trondheim as a test site for autonomous ships of all kinds, from container vessels to tugs. Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce announced that it expects autonomous container ships in international waters within 10 to 15 years. Other groups are working to do it sooner: One U.K. organization plans to have a solar-powered autonomous research vessel cross the Atlantic in 2019. Lloyd&apos;s Register, the 250-year-old ship-classification group, has already issued guidance for crewless operations.</p><p>All this could potentially have enormous benefits for the shipping industry -- and the world. Vast amounts of real-time data from the ships will allow fleet owners to optimize their routes (and profits) based on factors such as maintenance schedules, weather patterns, fuel prices and cargoes.

Previously a leader for IBM&apos;s IoT business and services in Europe, he&apos;s now transitioning to a role as a global leader for digital platforms for the public sector. Villa was also part of the core team involved with getting Watson&apos;s Munich HQ up and running in 2016.</p><p>On top of that, Villa is also a key member of the team at <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/iot-world-europe/?utm_source=iotworldnews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=iotworldus&utm_term=article&_ga=2.44234594.717938172.1494876888-1032430697.1494874300" target="_blank">Internet of Things World Europe</a>, sitting on the advisory board that guides the annual vision and strategy for the event. Ahead of June&apos;s Internet of Things World Europe conference, he talked IoT World News through IBM&apos;s Bavarian-based IoT playground.</p><h2>Watson collaborates internationally out of Munich</h2><p>If first impressions are anything to go by, Villa is as excited about Watson&apos;s latest IoT hub as anyone. He says the center hosts roughly 3,000 people, only half of whom are employed as IBM staff.</p><p>"We&apos;ve got consultants, scientists, engineers, solutions architects," he tells me, "while the other half come from co-located partners and clients."</p><p>And that&apos;s just a small percentage of the total number of partners and companies looking to collocate with IBM in Munich, to collaborate on their efforts to "drive from IoT concept to reality", as Villa puts it.</p><p>The high levels of interest are partially driven by the sheer number of sectors already being worked on there.</p><p>"We&apos;ve got a Watson IoT solution for consumer electronics, for automation, for insurance," Villa says, skimming the surface of what his team has on offer. "Over the next few months we&apos;ll draw them all into specific sectors. We are creating specific architectures and platforms for specific markets, with a number of solutions sitting on top of that."</p><p>These solutions address mainstream concerns like maintenance and quality, along with more niche applications like smart energy management. The older IBM&apos;s center becomes, the more granular these solutions are likely to get.</p><p>Villa lists some of the more noteworthy projects that are being worked on currently: highlights include work with Schaffler &#8212; "helping them <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/50673.wss" target="_blank">carve data out</a> from client assets and create additional valuable services like location analytics and maintenance" &#8212; BMW (cognitive cars), Local Motors (<a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49957.wss" target="_blank">3D-printed, electric autonomous vehicles</a>) and KONE &#8212; "<a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49957.wss" target="_blank">connecting millions of assets</a> like elevators across client sites for predictive maintenance and improved product quality".</p><h2>Accelerating Industry 4.0 with IoT & blockchain</h2><p>"Munich was selected for the presence of large partners there, as well as because it&apos;s in Europe," Villa explains, when asked why Germany&apos;s third largest city was chosen for the HQ&apos;s site. "Europe has led from an IoT perspective in terms of innovation and traction, because of the large amounts of manufacturing and work on Industry 4.0."</p><p>In IBM&apos;s eyes, the German government is also particularly progressive when it comes to new industrial technologies, supporting creativity labs and innovation. And while connecting everyday devices is an important part of the working being done by IBM in Munich, industrial IoT is undeniably their key focus.</p><p>"Most of what you read about in IoT is on the consumer side, but most of the business we&apos;ve seen, at least from an IBM perspective, is in the industrial space," says Villa. "That&apos;s where we&apos;ve gotten the most traction over the past few years. But it&apos;s not as flashy as wearables, right?"</p><p>The claim that inspiring case studies for the industrial internet are few and far between has been made many times &#8212; <a href="http://www.iotworldnews.com/author.asp?section_id=495&doc_id=730296" target="_blank">by us</a> as much as any other news outlet &#8212; but Villa says that&apos;s about to change, and that we&apos;ll be seeing IBM lead the charge.</p><p>"There are few case studies because we are in the second phase of IoT," he tells me.</p><p>"IoT has been around for maybe 20 years. At first it was about connecting assets. It was purely a technology conversation, and there was very little discussion about what we should be trying to do from the business perspective.</p><p>"In the last few years, the whole conversation has shifted towards what type of business opportunities there are, what type of platforms need developing, how to bring IoT together with analytics. The last few years we&apos;ve been stuck at pilots. Now we&apos;re moving forward."</p><p>While consumer IoT dominates the headlines and contemporary use cases, Villa is adamant that industrial IoT is where most of the "traction and acceleration" is today.</p><p>He foresees manufacturing as the breakthrough sector for IIoT deployment: "There are many IT technologies that are currently deployed in manufacturing. They are all, to certain degrees, becoming IoT enabled."</p><p>Another key focus of Watson&apos;s is <a href="http://www.iotworldnews.com/author.asp?section_id=495&doc_id=726730" target="_blank">blockchain</a>, the digital ledger technology touted for cyberpayments and IoT network and device security that has experts in the field fiercely divided.</p><p>Villa is a firm advocate of blockchain for IoT security, particularly where industry is concerned: "Blockchain is to supply chains what <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erp.asp" target="_blank">ERP</a> was to enterprise 20 years ago. It&apos;s going to be transformational."</p><p>He&apos;s pleased that "IBM is making a very bold bet in the blockchain area" &#8212; one he expects to pay off sooner rather than later, as Watson IoT is now moving beyond their pilot stages after a year and a half of work on one of the world&apos;s largest-scale <a href="https://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/platform/private-blockchain/" target="_blank">blockchain programmes</a>.</p><p>Where and how will it be applied, and what will the results be?

And with the vast majority of autonomous and driverless vehicles being solely electric we could be facing localised blackouts not seen since World War II.</p><p>So how does IoT help solve this? Surely IoT is about sensors, widgets and platforms?</p><p>One of the key principles of IoT is understanding the correlation between data gathered from interconnected devices; IoT isn&#8217;t an abstraction of big data analytics and machine learning.

In preparation she spoke with IoT World News to share Tel Aviv&apos;s biggest smart city successes and in which areas she predicts her city will prosper in the near future.</p><h2>What do you think has been Tel Aviv&apos;s biggest "smart city" success to date?</h2><p>"Tel Aviv was <a href="http://www.smartcityexpo.com/en/press/-/prensa/detalle/4425085/cloenda-smart-city-expo-2014" target="_blank">awarded the title</a> Best Smart City in the World at the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona In 2014. Tel Aviv won the award based on the DigiTel project, which is a civic engagement project focused on &apos;smart&apos; engagement with the residents. Since then, Tel Aviv has developed a smart city vision that focuses on the residents: improving the quality of life of the Tel Aviv residents by listening to the residents&apos; needs.</p><p>"The DigiTel platform, developed in Tel Aviv, strengthens connections with residents by providing information, benefits and personal service to all residents, enabling the City of Tel Aviv to strengthen ties with its residents, learn about their needs and allow them to take part in developing and advancing the city.</p><p>"So we began our DigiTel initiative to try and change the resident&#8217;s perception of the municipality, to show them how we were working to bring them value. The opinions are already quite different. Each time we launch a new project we see the positive effect it has on public opinion; we&#8217;re feeling a very positive shift in the public opinion about the DigiTel tools we provide for the citizens.</p><p>"That positive public opinion is great, but the real gain - from the municipality&#8217;s perspective &#8211; is that the public understands that the municipality is here for them and bringing them value. It offers them all kinds of information, events and services that are relevant to them.</p><p>"For instance, if you&#8217;ve told us you have an interest in marathons, we&#8217;ll send you an SMS with information about the Tel Aviv marathon. We also give discounts to Tel Aviv residents so, if you want to join the marathon and you live in Tel Aviv, we&#8217;ll give you a 20% discount when you register to participate.</p><p>"I believe that engagement is becoming a key aspect in implementing the smart city vision. Today, it is clearly understood that a city cannot become a smart city without strengthening ties with its residents and involving them as partners in the development processes. City residents must be an inseparable part of implementation of the change: the residents need to participate in decision-making processes and take shared responsibility for their future and that of the City. Cities wise enough to invest in this aspect will win the satisfaction of their residents."</p><h2>What do you see as the defining characteristics of a smart city? How does Tel Aviv embody these characteristics, and where would you like to see improvement?</h2><p>"People, processes and technology are the three elements which impact the success of smart city initiatives. Cities must recognize the needs of their residents, understand what drives the city&#8217;s economy, and create policies and targets which meet the needs of its residents, business owners and visitors.</p><p>"Tel Aviv&apos;s smart city initiatives are all facilitated by free citywide Wi-Fi in public areas and serve to improve municipal services, enhance residents&#8217; quality of life and create the conditions for sustainable urban development. Above all they exemplify the city&#8217;s active, intelligent role in employing technology to heighten civic engagement and ensure a city which is accessible and responsive to all.</p><p>"The municipality&#8217;s activities are largely concerned with social welfare, culture and leisure, urban planning, water and traffic management.</p><p>"We have three main challenges in this metropolis. First, we lack sufficient and efficient public transportation systems. We are just at the beginning of bringing the first line of light rail into the city.</p><p>"The second challenge is the cost of living and the cost of housing. Our third major issue is having 12% to 15% of illegal foreign workers, and we are dealing with this issue almost totally by ourselves."</p><h2>Which city do you think is the "smartest" in the world? How would you like Tel Aviv to emulate this city?</h2><p>"There is no specific answer - we are trying to get everything from everywhere.</p><p>"We all deal with the same issues. We deal with transport, sewage welfare and education. But we have different ways of solving problems so we listen to each other to find out if we have a good idea to solve something.</p><p>"For example, our bike sharing system happened because our mayor Ron Huldai was a guest of the mayor of Paris. Europe as a whole has good examples on housing. So this is the way I look to it, I can&apos;t say that there is only one particular model for something."</p><h2>And where do you stand on crowd sourced, third-party and open-source solutions? Has Tel Aviv tried any of these in order to develop as a smart city?</h2><p>"For our internet systems we are currently using an open source platform &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a>.</p><p>"We&apos;re looking into learning what more we can do with open source, as we see more software vendors moving in this direction."</p><p>&#8212; Jeremy Coward, Community Manager, IoT World News</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

One of the most shocking US election results in modern political history. A stunning repudiation of the Establishment and mainstream media. Brexit 2.0.</p><p>Now, the chief concern is less the "why?&apos;, more the "what happens next?" Trump&apos;s ascendancy to the White House has already sent global financial markets haywire, and, by the time the President-elect has blossomed into full-blown President, it&apos;s tough to think of an international industry that won&apos;t be in some way affected. The implications will be particularly significant for up-and-coming markets where exponential growth is anticipated over the next four years; even more so for those where the US was expected to lead the way.</p><p>Taking this into account, it seems likely that the global smart cities market will be affected. Because Donald Trump&apos;s presidential campaign was, to say the least, light on specifics when it came to policy, it&apos;s obviously difficult to make detailed predictions on how any industry will be impacted over the next four months, let alone the next four years. However, enough has been said to draw plenty of well informed conclusions, which can be developed day by day as further clarification on Trump&apos;s "actual" policies emerges.</p><p>Here&apos;s how we expect Donald Trump&apos;s administration to impact on smart city development in the US. Will smart cities play an important role in Trump&apos;s plans to make America "great" again?</p><p><em><strong>[Discover what&apos;s in store as America&apos;s public sector chiefs gather at <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/smart-cities/?utm_source=iot-institute&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tec6252&utm_term=article&utm_content=trump" target="_blank">Smart Cities Summit 2017</a> in Chicago this October.]</strong></em></p><h2>The White House Smart Cities initiative</h2><p>It&apos;s important to note that much of the progress being made with smart city technology in the US is privately funded, through companies working in isolation or public-private initiatives overseen at state level. Beyond that, most of America&apos;s smart city progress is not directed or funded at a federal level -- more often than not, each city is in it for themselves.</p><p>However, the Obama administration had shown keen interest in the development of the country&apos;s smart cities, seeing them as a new means to solve prominent problems faced by government, both modern and traditional. As Obama put it:</p><p>"If we can reconceive of our government so that the interactions and the interplay between private sector, nonprofits, and government are opened up, and we use technology, data, social media in order to join forces around problems, then there&apos;s no problem that we face in this country that is not soluble."</p><p>He backed up his words through action: namely $80 million in the form of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/26/fact-sheet-announcing-over-80-million-new-federal-investment-and" target="_blank">White House Smart Cities initiative</a>. The White House proposed that this investment would help America&apos;s cities become the "laboratories of innovation" that they need to become; to facilitate healthiness, equitable growth and combating climate change, with $15 million earmarked specifically for environmental projects.</p><p>We&apos;re not going to see anything approaching the same level of enthusiasm from the Trump administration. If his election campaign was anything to go by, there will be plenty of enthusiasm for reversing Obama&apos;s initiatives, along with minimizing the intervention of the federal government in general. He&apos;s already announced a blanket policy where every new federal regulation introduced means two existing regulations must be eliminated.</p><p>That said, there&apos;s no reason yet to believe that the White House Smart Cities initiative will be at the top of Trump&apos;s list of recent government schemes to axe. Provided it remains, the positive impact of this initiative will still be realized across America in years to come in countless ways.</p><p>But that&apos;s almost certainly it for the next four years under Trump, no matter what use cases emerge demonstrating the intrinsic value of smart city technology. His proposal to reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over ten years leaves little budget for any new funding whatsoever. Which is terrible timing, considering how crucial the next decade is likely to be to the proliferation of IoT in cities and beyond.</p><h2>Rallying the &apos;Rust Belt&apos;</h2><p>Whatever Trump does decide to put his limited finances towards, don&apos;t expect it to be particularly tech or city-based. He owes his election victory to the rural and blue-collar parts of the country, and they will be his top priority when the time comes to follow through on promises made during his campaign. Ergo, city-focused initiatives aren&apos;t about to be top of his agenda.</p><p>Nor is Trump about to make many investments in the automated technologies which are the bedrock of much industrial IoT and smart city development. Many of the Donald Trump faithful cast their votes expecting him to lead a resurgence of the American manufacturing industry and the jobs it provides. They expect this to be done through strict tariffs and renegotiated trade deals. But offshoring is no longer the American manufacturing worker&apos;s biggest threat -- it&apos;s automation.</p><p>According to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/heres-what-a-trump-presidency-means-for-the-internet-of-things-2016-11?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, "The IoT will either serve to stymie the efforts of a Trump administration or, more likely, be de-emphasized and advocated against by the executive branch due to the potential impacts on jobs." Trump can&apos;t risk being seen as the catalyst for the attrition of further manufacturing work. His only alternative is to oppose or at best be apathetic towards any technological advancements that will benefit IoT, tempering the country&apos;s smart city progress.</p><h2>Green initiatives make Trump see red</h2><p><img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/910_1.png" alt="" width="500" height="260" data-noderef="workspace://SpacesStore/b4a48435-e3ab-4ab0-b03e-0d899433df18" data-caption="<em>Trump brands global warming a conspiracy and lays the blame at the feet of China -- a nation that already has 300+ smart city projects on the go.</em>" data-credit="" /></p><p>When we&apos;ve asked city leaders which aspect of the smart city excites them most, transportation has proven to be the most popular response. Today connected cars mean avoiding traffic and finding parking spaces with ease; tomorrow&apos;s driverless cars will minimize road congestion and increase safety. Before long extensive fleets of autonomous vehicles could be a reality, freeing up huge amounts of road space and land as the requirement for individuals to own their own vehicles diminishes.</p><p>As Boston CIO and Smart Cities Summit speaker Jascha Franklin-Hodge told me: "By reusing all of that land currently used to store cars, we have a chance to massively reshape the physical environment of our cities and rethink the design of our city in general."</p><p>Trump has a long history of labeling climate change a hoax and is openly hostile to any organized efforts to reduce the world&apos;s carbon footprint. For his first 100 days in office, he&apos;s already pledged to cancel billions in payments to UN climate change programs and lift federal restrictions on the production of shale, oil, natural gas and coal.</p><p>Key American players like Tesla have led the drive to make electric vehicles that are autonomous, while buyers of those electric cars have enjoyed generous tax credits making the vehicles more affordable -- an initiative we hoped would speed up the production and adoption of connected cars in the long run. Under Trump, this initiative and others may be discontinued, and certainly won&apos;t be repeated.</p><p>A great many smart city projects beyond the automotive industry are also environmentally focused with green technology at their cores. The upcoming change in administration is bound to leave a chasm where the government&apos;s support and encouragement for these projects once was.</p><h2>Securing the right skillsets</h2><p>US-based smart city organizations may also become deprived on the skills front. Granted, the nation that gave birth to Silicon Valley will always be home to technology experts and pioneers, but stricter immigration policies often run the risk of turning away or putting off much-needed foreign talent.</p><p>A government that&apos;s unusually hostile towards tech development will also negatively affect America&apos;s chances of attracting newcomers who could fundamentally shape how cities of the future are development. Central government will suffer most in the skills department, following the recent indefinite hiring freeze on federal employees.</p><p>The same goes for America&apos;s tech giants that currently lead in the IoT space. Apple, Amazon and Google will all probably face roadblocks as they tackle increased scrutiny from the Republican party who want to see changes in stances on privacy and more assistance on national security issues.</p><h2>Where might smart city technology thrive in the new USA?</h2><p>Unfortunately it is a pretty glum outlook. Trump&apos;s presidency won&apos;t prevent the US from being a major player on the smart cities scene, but will almost definitely result in the nation falling short of what it could&apos;ve been.</p><p>It is worth noting that Trump&apos;s intent to focus on developing America, to the detriment of the country&apos;s international ties, might necessitate new use of IoT technologies. If his government truly intends to boost America&apos;s infrastructure like none before it, the smartest way to do so will be with smart technology. Urban areas might not be his chief focus, but smart city technology will always be applicable beyond the cities themselves.</p><p>Perhaps Trump&apos;s infamous wall might also have a "smart side" to it? Despite the heavy criticism this proposal has faced, it was a hallmark of his election campaign and so far he&apos;s sticking with it, as made clear in his "<a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/501451368/here-is-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days" target="_blank">100-day action plan to Make America Great Again</a>":</p><p>"The End Illegal Immigration Act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall."</p><p>For the Great Wall to be anything other than an abject failure, it&apos;ll require some pretty state-of-the-art technology to prevent all those with ladders or spades getting around it! Cameras, sensors and surveillance systems would all be in the highest demand right across the 2,000-mile stretch that would have to be covered.</p><p>Trump has recently admitted that at least part of this barrier may have to consist of fencing -- a concession that many have hailed as the beginnings of what was always an unfeasible, wildly impractical plan unraveling.</p><p>A far more realistic, cost-effective method of policing the America-Mexico border would be the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), better known as drones -- tipped to become an integral part of the IoT in many sectors from law enforcement to agriculture. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/persistent-surveillance-systems-has-been-watching-baltimore-for-months/" target="_blank">Case studies</a> from the likes of Persistent Surveillance Systems have already demonstrated just how effectively drones can be used to police extremely large areas with severely limited resources.</p><p>But ultimately Trump&apos;s efforts to curtail immigration to such an extent will be an expensive endeavor however he goes about it, particularly for a government on such a lean budget.</p><p>What luck Mexico will be footing the bill&#8230;</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Ahead of the conference, IoT World News wanted to pick his brain and learn what smart city projects Boston has underway.</p><h2>You&apos;ve said you don&apos;t like to use the term &apos;smart city.&apos; Why&apos;s that?</h2><p>"The term &apos;smart city&apos; usually means technology-focused and vendor-driven, with aims to integrate tech into government operations. Companies that use the term often have a piece of technology they&apos;re looking to sell, and it becomes a circular conversation where the goal is the use of technology, which becomes easily disconnected from government&apos;s underlying mission.</p><p>"Our job in government is to improve quality of life for the people that we serve, making the city we operate in a better place. How do we make our schools a great place to get an education? How do we give people greater access to green space? How can we create affordable housing and give people access to the transportation services they need to get to and from home or work? These are our priorities.</p><p>"The technology we use, whether it&apos;s &apos;smart&apos; or traditional, exists to serve these larger objectives. I don&apos;t necessarily care how smart of a city we are -- I care how good we are at helping people with their daily lives. Technology helps, but we keep a frame around it. I&apos;m always reminding myself and the people around me that our job is not to deliver technology, it&apos;s to help other parts of the city deliver great outcomes."</p><h2>So how is Boston using smart technology to improve the lives of its citizens?</h2><p>"We are doing a lot with technology to improve the effectiveness of government operations with data, analytics and digital channels, to meet the expectations people have today about how they should be able to interact with their government.</p><p>"For example, we use data captured by the app Waze to monitor traffic patterns and road speeds. It&apos;s ingested and analyzed to track congestion and run experiments for new approaches to city policy. For instance, we&apos;ve changed our enforcement policy on double parking -- now enforcement officers tell people to move along rather than ticketing them. And when we retimed traffic signals, we used Waze data to widen our analysis of the area affected.</p><p>"These impacts are measured with data that we didn&apos;t have access to ten years ago. These new tools let us test more experiments in a shorter time period and stay agile, learning faster and delivering outcomes faster."</p><h2>How advanced is Boston as a smart city currently?</h2><p>"In many ways, we&apos;re very sophisticated, with analytics programs that are very cutting-edge as cities go. Boston is right up there with Chicago, New York and New Orleans.</p><p>"But we distinguish ourselves by being less focused on hard-core math and more focused on how we can make data useful in an everyday context. Sometimes the most effective use of data is finding the way to present it that is most accessible, often to an executive that is not a data specialist, creating dashboards that tell a story with the city&apos;s data. We work with these executives city-wide to develop better uses for data and make the data more relevant to them.</p><p>"Our digital resources are second-to-none. The city&apos;s website has been entirely redeveloped to put people first -- we learned how our residents think about services, and reordered the site to match their view of the services we provide.</p><p>"Hopefully, this will be the way of the future for other governments building digital experiences."</p><h2>How would you like Boston to look in 10 years&apos; time? What smart city characteristics would you like to see developed?</h2><p>"I expect our government will have a lot more people and divisions with skills that exist within our own department. To put it into perspective, our department used to have a typing pool -- that used to be seen as a specialist skill that you couldn&apos;t expect everyone to do. Which seems comical, but some of the things we do currently, like data analytics and visualization, will probably become a lot more commonplace ten years from now.</p><p>"I want my team to innovate and educate, so that this work won&apos;t have to be outsourced to other teams or companies. Even now, the reality is that any department not incorporating technology isn&apos;t living up to its potential or meeting our constituents&apos; expectations for how public services should be delivered.</p><p>"Otherwise, my aspiration for Boston aren&apos;t fundamentally rooted in technology. I want this to continue to be a diverse, affordable, healthy, beautiful city to live in. I want all of the things I and my fellow residents cherish to remain, and see further progress with our priorities: housing affordability, equitable access to education opportunities, and safe and reliable transportation.</p><p>"I don&apos;t think it&apos;s my job to just say &apos;here&apos;s how I want tech to be in Boston&apos;. It&apos;s about how I can support these priorities."</p><h2>Are there any particularly outlandish solutions you&apos;d like to bring to Boston?</h2><p>"One of the biggest problems we&apos;ll wrestle with moving forward is changes to transportation systems and the role played by autonomous vehicles. A future where people use a massive fleet of autonomous vehicles as their main source of transportation has huge implications, including land use. By reusing all of that land currently used to store cars, we have a chance to massively reshape the physical environment of our cities and rethink the design of our city in general.</p><p>"We&apos;re on the cusp of some really major technological transformation, and I want to help reshape Boston to benefit its residents."</p><h2>Is there a time frame for when autonomous vehicles will be used?</h2><p>"The people I talk to on the optimistic side say fully autonomous vehicles will be on the road in five years, or maybe 15 years. And we&apos;re already feeling this a bit now in the form of services like Uber and Lyft -- they operate in a similar way that an autonomous network of vehicles might operate."</p><h2>What roles should the public and private sectors ideally play as a smart city is developed?</h2><p>"Private sector organizations have a big role to play; in no modern country is government the exclusive provider of every service. Boston wants to encourage private sector investment and innovation, as private companies can often innovate at a quicker pace.</p><p>"But we need to be mindful that in government we have fundamentally unique responsibilities. There&apos;s no private company in the world that has the obligation to treat every person equally, or deliver services even if they can&apos;t be done profitably. Meanwhile, our public education system is not a profit-making enterprise, our private education system is not a profit-making enterprise, nor should these things ever be profit-making enterprises, because we do them for greater societal good.</p><p>"So there&apos;s a healthy interplay where the private sector can be faster and nimbler, but we&apos;ve got to make sure that equity, fairness and all our big social goals are represented, and that we make progress on those things."</p><h2>What are your views on cybersecurity in smart cities? Does that fall under your remit?</h2><p>"Well, it&apos;s no secret that government of all stripes is struggling to stay ahead. There have been and will be data breaches that affect cities. It&apos;s the job of people like me and our CISO to make sure, as we build new technologies, that we&apos;re thoughtful about how these technologies might be exploited or undermined, and to make investments appropriately.</p><p>"Talk to people whose job it is to keep systems cyber-secure, and they&apos;re often a depressed bunch because they realize they&apos;re up against such tremendous challenges. They know it&apos;s not a war you win, it&apos;s just a case where you&apos;re already trying to remain one step ahead."</p><h2>We&apos;ve been told before that cities will need Chief Smart Cities Officers. Do you subscribe to that view?</h2><p>"No, I think it&apos;s a terrible idea. Cities need to be focused on the problems they solve, not just the technology they provide. We need to be putting people in roles where they are providing support for services and residents, and helping to educate other departments to utilize technology to do the same."</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

That&apos;s certainly the case for Paul Jauregui, who oversees all aspects of marketing, branding and communications at Praetorian, a collective of highly technical engineers and developers that provides a suite of security assessment and advisory services.</p><p>His very obvious passion for the Internet of Things has led him to become acting business lead for Austin, Texas-based <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/" target="_blank">Praetorian</a>&apos;s IoT security assessment and advisory services.</p><p>"Recently, I was featured in Fortune Magazine for my work on Praetorian&apos;s Internet of Things Map Project," Jauregui tells IoT World News, "during which I guided a team of security engineers who were developing an autonomous, handheld, IoT-sniffing payload capable of discovering, fingerprinting and mapping local area IoT devices and networks.</p><p>"And of course, we had to strap it to a drone. On one of its first flights, our autonomous drone-carrying payload discovered 726 unique IoT devices over an 18-minute flight and fingerprinted the manufacturer names on 465 of those devices."</p><h2>Keeping the ever-growing IoT secure</h2><p>By now, most of those aware of IoT are pretty familiar with the statistics regarding its expected reach -- 25-billion smart devices by 2020 (Gartner), and a global market worth $14.4 trillion by 2022 (PwC). Those numbers alone are fairly intimidating, but what&apos;s truly scary is the prospect we may be unable to sufficiently secure this mass network of automated connectivity. </p><p>"Joining the Internet of Things adds many new layers of complexity to any product environment. New technologies, existing technologies working together in new ways, limited standards and competing protocols all add to the challenge of delivering a secure connected product to the market," Jauregui says.</p><p>"The expected growth of global IoT deployments over the coming years and the promise of expansive interconnectivity compounds the issues around security even further. One thing that will be needed by 2020 is the notion of a shared responsibility model for IoT security -- one that delineates boundaries across the entire IoT supply chain -- from chip to code -- and between IoT producers, providers and consumers.</p><p>"For example, in the context of a smart city environment, as everything gets connected, it will get harder to know what assets different groups would be responsible for protecting and reacting to. Where do you draw that line of responsibility? When a potential breach occurs at a parking meter at one end of a smart city and traverses its way across networks to impact other back-end systems, who&apos;s responsible?"</p><p>Penetration testing is one of many practices that helps companies ramp up their cybersecurity efforts, and one in which Praetorian specializes.</p><p>"Penetration testing activities help organizations identify security weaknesses in systems the same way a real-world attacker would -- by hacking them," says Jauregui. "This enables organizations to better understand and ultimately minimize the risk associated with IoT systems.</p><p>"Praetorian&apos;s IoT penetration testing services take a holistic approach to security testing by reviewing the entire product ecosystem, from chip to code, while prioritizing vulnerabilities so our clients can successfully balance risk with time-to-market pressures. It provides end-to-end security assurance that helps organizations better deliver and deploy secure connected products.</p><p>"That ultimately translates into business value in the form of one, reduced reputational risk and increased brand protection for consumer-facing IoT product companies, two, sales enablement for IoT solutions companies selling into enterprise, and three, mission-critical assurances for an industrial IoT deployment."</p><h2>IoT at its strongest and weakest</h2><p>IoT already spans many industries and has the potential to impact pretty much ever industry in existence. I asked Jauregui where the IoT is currently strongest and where it&apos;s weakest in terms of cybersecurity. </p><p>"The greatest weaknesses and strengths affecting the business of IoT today does not have anything to do with a specific set of technologies, but rather perceptions," he counters.</p><p>"In today&apos;s connected world, the perception of security risk alone, even if not realized, can still negatively impact the consumer confidence necessary for new technologies to meet their full market potential. Recent, high-profile data breaches covered in the media have heightened consumers&apos; awareness of data security and privacy issues. As a result, consumer adoption may suffer until vendors can adequately address IoT security and privacy concerns.</p><p>"On the other hand, there is a healthy perception shared across industry that sees security as mission critical to the IoT&apos;s future growth and success. Whenever IoT is talked about at a conference or in the media, the word &apos;security&apos; is never far behind. This industry perception helps prioritize security awareness and action, which is a major strength.</p><p>"With that said, there are always budgetary considerations that come into play and, at the end of the day, I very much recognize that security is not a technology challenge. It&apos;s an economic challenge. Over the next five to ten years, security resources will increase as viable IoT business models and value creation opportunities solidify across every industry. This will also drive changes in consumer confidence as IoT&apos;s perceived value begins to outweigh perceived risk."</p><h2>What&apos;s the solution?</h2><p>Nevertheless, the monumental risks and lack of comprehensive security solutions in this area mean many companies are competing to provide the one technology that might solve IoT&apos;s cybersecurity issues for good. But have any of them managed to produce anything that comes close to achieving this goal? </p><p>"When I ask my security engineers this question, the response is usually something like, &apos;There isn&#8217;t a single solution that provides the most assistance.&apos; They remind me that everything in IoT is about limiting attack vectors and risk," Jauregui says.</p><p>"Things like XMPP and other pub/sub models encourage good security hygiene by forcing the device to make outbound connections instead of listening for network activity. In addition, lots of hardware problems can be solved by choosing chips with secure elements and well-defined SDKs. It&apos;s promising to see unified cloud solutions emerge, because there is a high likelihood that network requirements will be significantly vetted (in the case of IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon)."</p><p>And what are the potential ramifications if the industry can&apos;t find a way to make the ever-growing global IoT network secure.</p><p>"That entirely depends on the type of IoT solution we&apos;re talking about and its associated risk profile," he concludes. "We work with clients who develop everything from connected medical devices to connected children&apos;s toys and beyond. I think we can all agree that the ramifications of security weaknesses found in an Internet-enabled pacemaker are much higher than the same weakness found in a connected toy.</p><p>"With that said, our team is starting to partner with major semiconductor manufacturers, IoT cloud providers, and the open source security community to draft guiding frameworks for new IoT security verification standards. These frameworks will take several factors into account, such as a device&apos;s risk profile, so that the appropriate level of end-to-end security assurances are delivered by IoT vendors and recognized by end consumers."</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

"We do so in order to make the Virgin Active experience as fulfilling as possible."</p><p>And that&apos;s where his main interest in the Internet of Things stems from.

I asked Caddy what insights he could share on the future of IoT, from an enterprise standpoint.</p><p>"We&apos;re in the very early days, certainly in my area," he begins. "Homes and cars have been early battlefields. Health and fitness is an interesting area, but quite basic and primitive in comparison. Today we&apos;re seeing interest and enthusiasm for what IoT can do to solve existing problems, such as step-counters, introduced five to six years ago, which haven&apos;t gone too far.</p><p>"For our industry, the next generation will be dictated by the combination of devices, which themselves will be smarter and more connected, and even more so software and machine learning to integrate with the IoT for a more comprehensive experience and smarter insights. For gyms, people do want convenience, but they want feedback on their progress even more, and that&apos;s what they&apos;re not getting enough of."</p><p>The market for wearables like step-counters has fallen short of its potential in the eyes of many. Yet it probably remains the IoT technology most applicable to health and fitness, explaining why it&apos;s an area Virgin Active is already acting to cash in on.</p><p>"We&apos;re trialing the integration of wearables in our South African business, where we&apos;ll roll out the new products for members over the next few months. The aim is to boost reward and recognition, by acknowledging physical activity both inside and outside of our clubs.</p><p>"We want to be smart about sharing knowledge on staying healthy that we have within the business. We want to take the information from the machines and devices our members are using, and turn that data into actionable insight," Caddy continues. "People usually leave gyms because they get bored or stop enjoying the experience, which is frustrating for Virgin Active, given how much we offer."</p><p>The better Caddy and co. can understand what motivates and puts off their users, the better they can combat this attrition. Caddy says that they&apos;ve got a few immediate plans for wearables involving business partnerships, with the likes of Fitbit and other prominent companies.</p><p>However, he&apos;s most excited about their NFC wristband experiments being trialed. These devices will get you in and out of gyms, log you in and out of machines, and be used to handle lockers and payments on an automatic basis. "A device that convenient is a clear win-win," he tells me.</p><h2>CIOs and their firehoses of information</h2><p>Many leading experts across the IoT industry have hailed the imminent coming of the "Chief IoT Officer," arguing that the sheer size and scope of the task is too big to be integrated into an existing executive job role. I asked Caddy whether IoT would fall under the CIO&apos;s remit, or if future businesses would need "CIoTOs."</p><p>"So, IoT will become prevalent across a whole different range of things," he begins. "This &apos;smart center&apos; for connectivity is applicable everywhere. The net result is data, the increases of which could be a massive problem if not thought about in advance.</p><p>"We&apos;re seeing a step-change in data storage taking place because of the data provided by IoT devices -- that&apos;s still under the CIO&apos;s remit. We [the CIOs] need to know how to control this firehose of information. Some CIOs still have a hardware-oriented view of the world, and that&apos;s going to change. The devices may not always fall within the CIO&apos;s job role, but collecting the data and using it certainly will.</p><p>"But really I see no need for a Chief IoT Officer at any point specifically."</p><h2>IoT where it doesn&apos;t need to be</h2><p>Caddy goes on to elaborate on the role data will play as enterprises further embrace and develop IoT.</p><p>"To be able to interpret and do good things with data is very important, especially where it&apos;s related to the customer journey. As the price-point of IoT devices comes down, people will start putting them everywhere -- including where they don&apos;t need to be or shouldn&apos;t be. We&apos;ll have IoT devices everywhere, and it will be a massive distraction, as people &apos;throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks.&apos;</p><p>"Every application of IoT should start with a map of the customer journey, to decide at which points these devices are actually necessary, steering clear of distractions. We&apos;ve seen a similar thing with beacons -- they&apos;ve been around for three to four years, and still haven&apos;t found their real niche."</p><p>"I get inundated with people telling me they can connect sensors to dumbbells and running machines," he chuckles. "But why? Tell me, how is that actually going to help me?"</p><p>Of course, even now there are plenty of successful IoT applications greatly benefiting consumers. I asked Caddy what his favorite example of IoT being used to benefit the customer is.</p><p>"As I said before, our new use of wristbands could be game-changing," he says. "Compared to other methods for entry or payment, they&apos;re easier to access and harder to lose, meaning a generally more seamless process. We&apos;ve had great customer feedback wherever we&apos;ve trialed them so far.</p><p>"My favorite uses of IoT are those where the person ends up getting much more than they expected, and this is definitely one of those."</p><h2>Will voice control be our next technology step change?</h2><p>Up until 2011, Caddy was CTO at easyJet where he oversaw the release of a highly successful app. We finished our conversation with speculation over what role apps will play as the IoT grows, and what big technology might come next.</p><p>"It&apos;s far too early to claim the app will die out. I understand the notion, but people generally underestimate how long these major technological shifts take to take place. Any potential alternatives, like AI or bots, are just too immature at this point in time. And we&apos;ve seen Apple struggle with its Watch and fall short of their aims so far -- plenty of factors mean the speech-activated technology isn&apos;t as good as it needs to be to take over."</p><p>"But I&apos;m open to the idea," he continues. "A point in time in the future where you&apos;re truly conversing with your devices as you would another human being -- but that&apos;s a long way off. I think another step-change is required first, like that from computer to iPhone in 2007. Something must be fundamentally better to justify us moving away from tech that is now ubiquitous."</p><p>I asked if he had any specific predictions for what might bring the next big step-change in IoT.</p><p>"Well we&apos;re always going to be flawed when making short-term bets on technology," he muses. "I still haven&apos;t got my flying car. But one of the interesting things at the moment is the battle over voice control, with Siri, Alexa, Google and the voice-controlled home.</p><p>"I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the biggest upcoming trend or something less. But people seem to be falling in love with Amazon&apos;s Alexa, and what Apple&apos;s done with Siri and iOS10 is very impressive.

Yet with the Internet of Things (IoT) this is absolutely the case, and anybody that says otherwise is not being straight with you.</p><p>The reason for this is that IoT is not a single technology or a single market; it&apos;s a domain within which multiple powerful and rapidly moving digital technologies (cloud, virtualization, mobile broadband, semiconductor, artificial intelligence, computer vision, augmented reality and blockchain, to name a few) are interacting with traditional physical markets (mining, manufacturing and logistics) and consumer lives (smart homes, connected cars and smart cities), and transforming entire value chains and business models.</p><p>In creating this community site, we deliberated about the categories to cover, and what is hot and meaningful to the broader audience interested in the IoT domain. As you can see from the category headings, we chose 16: eight are market based and eight are technology based, and each of these can be broken down further. For example, in the case of components, we could include CPUs, GPUs, sensors, MEMs, connectivity modules, and even robots and drones. All areas have technologies that continue to develop, and where business interests are realigning though investments and acquisitions.</p><p>From a high level perspective &#8211; or, let&apos;s say, from &apos;The Bell Tower&apos; -- how have these categories developed during the past 12 months? And what changes will we see during the next 12 months? These assessments are totally my own opinion, based on everything I have researched, heard and observed, and they are, by design, a little provocative as I&apos;m looking at it from a telecoms and mobile operator perspective, which, I suspect, is different from that of participants within the market or technology categories.</p><p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/8757_1.jpg" alt="" data-noderef="workspace://SpacesStore/c8642515-2d62-4ef7-a7ae-2584abd7f53c" data-credit="" data-caption="Green: positive movement   Yellow: status quo  <br>  One arrow: standard development  Two arrows: rapid development  Three arrows: hyper activity" /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Let&apos;s start with the markets:</p><p><strong>Automotive</strong> has seen an increased focus by traditional car companies, such as Ford, on delivering fully autonomous cars by the year 2020. The CTO of BMW also recently commented that "connectivity" is the most important aspect of cars going forward. In recent weeks, the 3GPP has approved the LTE V2V standard that will compete with DSRC or WAVE as a solution for cars communicating with each other at 5.9GHz. All we need is for the regulators to agree which standard to use and where! The use of Global SIMs and split billing has attracted 20 car and truck brands to use AT&T&apos;s LTE network in the US where they have 9 million connected car connections. All things seem set for increased activity and development in this space over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>Healthcare</strong> has proved to be a difficult IoT market, not because the potential isn&#8217;t there, but because of practicalities related to regulation and certification, as well as liability and an inbred resistance to change, particularly where complex human and technological systems are involved. Security scares about the vulnerability of insulin pumps being hacked are one of the challenges the industry has to face, but this will not deter startups from addressing specific opportunities. A number of global mobile operators have recognized that the key to this is providing the support mechanisms to these startups so that, as success occurs, scalability can be achieved.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Industrial /Enterprise</strong> IoT is attracting huge interest because, if companies can link operations technology with IT using modern communications and cloud technology, they stand a greater chance of surviving competitively and transforming their own company, as well as the ecosystems they participate in. From a telecoms and mobile operators&#8217; perspective, if they can supply integrated solutions that leverage the partners within the operators&#8217; ecosystems, it would provide an opportunity to deliver significant value added services beyond pure connectivity.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Smart Homes</strong> seem to hold so much potential as the lead market for IoT, with numerous devices from thermostats to door locks for home automation, and video cameras for security being available in local DIY and electronics stores. However, security breaches and the complexity of getting things to work nicely together have slowed adoption. The bundling of these as integrated solutions, offered by cable and telecom providers, seemed a natural solution to the complexity but the economics for both the provider and the consumer have yet to reach a point to ignite the market. This is unlikely to change over the next 12 months unless better user interface technologies - such as Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Alexa&#8221; &#8211; can make setup, integration and control of the devices much easier.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Smart Cities</strong> (and in particular smart lighting projects) have been a growth area as large urban communities struggle with rising costs and ageing infrastructure. Most of these initiatives are being carried out on a city-by-city basis, but efforts are being expended to share the knowledge gained so that accelerated adoption can occur. In Asian and Middle Eastern countries, national government sponsored projects are much broader and more aggressive in scope. This market will remain at the same pace over the next 12months, as the projects bed in and learnings are shared. It&#8217;s anticipated that 2018 will be an aggressive growth year for smart cities.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Energy</strong> (and in particular smart meters) has been a growth area for a number of years, aided by government mandates and by a desire for smarter distribution economics as well as flexible pricing. The requirement to connect these meters has resulted in a number of alternative communications technologies and companies to compete with cellular providers. This market will continue in a growth phase for at least the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Retail</strong> has the challenge of bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds to meet the needs of the 90 percent of consumers that still visit stores to shop. Many startups in this area are partnering with big name stores, and exploring everything from shelf stocking robots to asset tracking, and consumer behavior tracking using beacons. Some mobile operators are experimenting with mashing their subscriber data with store data to provide more accurate predictions of consumer traffic patterns. This is still early stage experimentation, and will likely stay that way over the next 12 months. </p><p><strong>&#8226; Consumer Wearables</strong> are still looking for the &#8220;iPhone moment&#8221;: the combination of technology and user experience that meets an insatiable need. Fitness devices and smart watches continue to evolve, and increasingly watch and jewelry brands are flirting with the combination of technology with desirable design but nothing has yet ignited the market. It&#8217;s possible that some augmented ambient interface could emerge over the next 12 months but, if it doesn&#8217;t, then the trajectory will likely remain the same.  </p><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.ioti.com/sites/iot-institute.com/files/542_1.png" alt="" data-noderef="workspace://SpacesStore/859d6953-4b40-4a2e-b562-a6d12ce33af8" data-credit="" data-caption="Green: positive movement   Yellow: status quo   Red: negative movement<br> One arrow: standard development  Two arrows: rapid development" /></p><p>  <br />From a technology perspective, there has been and will increasingly be an intensification of developments across the board: </p><p><strong>&#8226; Connectivity</strong> has been an area of intense activity over the last 12 months as the cellular industry scrambled to agree and develop low-power wide-area (LPWA) technologies to compete with SigFox, Ingenu and LoRa Alliance offerings. The next 12 months will be even more active as trials of the CAT-M1 and NB-IoT technologies are trialed and deployed, and the competition attempts to beat the cellular operators to market.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Components</strong> are the vital ingredients of the IoT. Continued shrinkage of footprint, power consumption and cost, together with increased compute capability for machine learning on devices, create ever smarter sensor networks. This area is also an active acquisition focus, with NXP being acquired by Qualcomm following ARM&#8217;s takeover by Softbank. The components area will remain highly active over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Cloud/Fog</strong> has become an increasing topic of conversation any time that IoT is on the agenda. The requirement to have intelligence at the edge of the enterprise and network has accelerated this interest in fog computing. The OpenFog Consortium, started in November 2015, has created an &apos;OpenFog Architecture&apos; to accelerate standardized solutions. This area will be a growth market over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Security</strong> is on everyone&#8217;s agenda, primarily due to fears about hacking, and the recent use of IoT devices for DDOS attacks. A bigger issue is the fact that many legacy devices are unable to support security, and new devices don&#8217;t have security built in by design. Mobile operators, cloud providers and systems integrators are looking at this area with an end-to-end approach, and silicon providers are looking to provide security on chip solutions. Interest in this area will intensify, in terms of focus and market opportunities, for end-to-end rather than point solutions over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Analytics / Artificial Intelligence</strong> (including the use of machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data generated by things) will enable a better prediction of performance and service requirements. These opportunities to lower costs, enhance cycle times and change business models are the things that excite companies, especially those in the enterprise and industrial space. Analytics / AI is already becoming synonymous with IoT, and this will intensify over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Developers</strong> are attracted to standardized platforms or markets where there is significant opportunity for growth. Some of the leading mobile operators have been creating ecosystems that support large communities of developers, and have worked with silicon vendors and manufacturers to produce standardized development kits. Equally, alliances and consortia, such as the Industrial Internet Consortium, have created test bed environments to enable startups and developers to work and prove out concepts with large industrial companies. Google, with its Brillo and Weave platforms as well as the recent release of its AI code, is greatly aiding development of this area. It can be anticipated that this process will attract more developers, and lead to increasing numbers of solutions being introduced across a broad spectrum of markets over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Business</strong> interest in systems integration and business model transformation related to IoT is ramping up in terms of discussion and investigation. However, translating this into action is still at an initial stage except for a few early adopters. One of the challenges is that systems integration requires the bringing together of different skills, comprising IT, communications and operations technologies, that few companies or external specialists have. We can assume that this area will continue to ferment over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>&#8226; Beacons / LBS</strong> using low energy Bluetooth (BLE) for internal navigation, precise location and proximity specific notifications, particularly in retail applications, have frankly been disappointing to date. Adoption of the technology has been impacted by the real and perceived complexity of deployment, not least of which is that there&#8217;s no common app for users. The next 12 months could prove interesting, since Apple&#8217;s earphone jack removal could mean that people will leave Bluetooth enabled all the time, but will only opt in if they have the right app on their phone. Longer term, the introduction of LTE device-to-device technology could simplify the process for consumers and retailers. </p><p>So am I calling it right? Let me know your thoughts and perspectives on how you think IoT will ramp up over the next 12 months and be sure to check back on this community regularly to find out what actually happens (and to get involved in the debate).</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Wang is founder of <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/">Constellation Research</a>, a Silicon Valley firm that advises Global 2000 companies on the future, business strategy, and disruptive technology adoption. While the IBM chip process is at least three years away from a commercially viable chip, the breakthrough is important, as planners and designers will be anticipating this capability.</p><p>&#8220;Silicon nanosheets at 5 nanometers would have been unimaginable just three years ago,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;This new process helps organizations imagine new possibilities in computing, especially applications that use very little power and are extremely mobile, such as AR/VR inside biomedical devices, omnipresent cognitive applications, and even more precision in IoT.&#8221;</p><p>The announcement was made at the 2017 Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits, being held in Kyoto, Japan, this week. The scientists involved on the IBM chip research were working as part of the IBM-led Research Alliance at SUNY Polytechnic Institute Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering&#8217;s <a href="http://fdibestpractice.org/pdf/SUNY%20Albany%20Nanotech%20Complex.pdf">NanoTech Complex</a> in Albany, N.Y.</p><p>Compared with the leading-edge 10-nanometer technology available in the market, a nanosheet-based 5-nanometer technology can deliver 40% performance enhancement at fixed power, or 75% power savings at matched performance, according to the <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/52531.wss">IBM announcement</a>. The power savings could also mean that the batteries in smartphones and other mobile products could last two to three times longer than today&apos;s devices before needing to be charged. On a mobile phone with 10 percent battery life, 5-nanometer chips would lend hours, not minutes, of power before needing to recharge, for instance.</p><p>The development hinged on changing how the elements of the chip were arranged and the materials used, according to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/06/5-nanometer-transistors/">IBM blog</a> detailing the announcement from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/huiming-bu-04313145/">Huiming Bu</a>, director of Silicon Integration and Device Research.

Everything from a smart fridge to monitoring a fleet of corporate cars and recording data on energy usage is possible through connected devices, but also increases the burden on security professionals to keep corporate networks and resources secure, thanks to a rapidly increasing attack surface.</p><p>According to Hal Lonas, chief technology officer at cybersecurity firm Webroot, machine learning and artificial intelligence can help cybersecurity experts take on this challenge, especially as the problem is made more complex due to many IoT vendors considering security little more than an afterthought.</p><p>"The security industry needs to get ahead of the problem we&#8217;re creating, and the only way to do that is with automation," Lonas says.</p><p>IoT is a new and immature market. Outdated firmware, zero-day vulnerabilities and poor patching cycles are only the tip of the threat iceberg, and as threat actors become more sophisticated, so will attack vectors.</p><p>The emergence of virtual reality (VR) adds to the burden. VR and augmented reality (AR) technology is now appearing in headsets, mobile apps and games, collecting even more data from us than standard e-commerce companies, tracking cookies and social media.</p><p>While some of this data is collected by the likes of Oculus and Microsoft and is beneficial to vendors and advertisers, this treasure trove of deeply personal data also must be kept safe from intrusion.</p><p>Should only one vulnerable IoT, mobile or gaming device slip through the net, an entire network and the personal data of users stored within could become a cyberattacker&#8217;s playpen.</p><p>Perhaps, one day, machine learning could prevent such breaches occurring.</p><p>"Machine learning is not a silver bullet, but it is an essential tool in the box for keeping ahead of, or at least quickly detecting, some of the latest types of attack," Lonas says.</p><p>Machine learning is nothing new. The concept <a href="http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/articles/big-data/machine-learning-brings-concrete-aspect-to-iot.html" target="_blank">first emerged</a> in the 1900s and has expanded to include deep learning, data analysis, pattern detection and, for the purpose of security, anomaly alerts.</p><p>Analysts set with the task of monitoring connected devices on a corporate network have only so much time and so many tools at hand to watch over all network entry points and potential avenues for exploit.</p><p>However, machine learning can provide the bridge to utilize the vast amounts of data that IoT devices produce and compile this information into patterns which can be used to understand whether a device or not is compromised -- as well as alert operators when suspicious activity is detected.</p><p>"Machine learning can monitor thousands of variables, versus the handful that people can, all while never getting tired, lazy, or taking a day off," Lonas said. "This in turn frees up analysts&#8217; time to work on more valuable areas of security, reducing the time between a threat being introduced and our ability defend against it."</p><p>Machine learning can also limit human error and reduce costs, but the technology is still within early developmental stages and there are many hurdles which need to be overcome before such solutions will be viable for IoT security.</p><p>Lonas says it is "incredibly hard to get machine learning right" due to the need to balance algorithms with performance, as well as deal with the requirement to compile threat alerts into publishable notices on time. Merging AI and advanced technology with legacy systems would also, likely, prove a challenge for businesses -- assuming they wish to invest in machine learning security in the first place.</p><p>Today analysts can only digest less than 10% of the unstructured security data available, Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security, told IoT World News. If vendors and enterprise players are going to utilize data flows effectively to keep products and networks safe from cyberattack, machine learning is a requirement to leverage data which is currently wasted.</p><p>Machine learning cannot, however, be the one-stop solution to IoT security. False positive and false negatives will crop up, and this is when human operators must come into play. Machines are good at repetitive tasks, but humans are the best option for applying technology to problem solving.</p><p>AI solutions may be able to utilise deep learning to deal with small attacks without assistance, but human operators will also still need to teach AI how to cope with more sophisticated attacks going forward.</p><p>There needs to be a "sweet spot", says Lonas, between unsupervised and supervised machine learning "in order to both deflect attacks and uncover new vulnerabilities".</p><p>"Fewer people needed for greater accuracy and coverage is the goal, but this will never get to zero," Lonas continued. "The bad guys will continue to invent new attacks, so people will always be needed to innovate our defences."</p><p>According to Simon Crosby, chief technology officer at Bromium, the adoption of machine learning is likely to be difficult due to a small number of people skilled in AI, the implementation of domain-specific languages for machine learning solutions, overall investment and the shift of traditional security teams to automatic workflows.</p><p>Vendors need to work on minimizing these problems if machine learning is going to take a prominent place in IoT security, not only in the enterprise but in the VR realm and consumer domain, including gaming and mobile devices.</p><p>"The industry is still in its infancy," Crosby added. "The big providers -- Apple, Google, Microsoft -- already apply machine learning to the consumer world. The opportunity remains for other vendors to apply machine learning techniques to solve enterprise problems, and that market is nascent at best."</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Prescription drug adherence is a big problem in the U.S., costing the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars per year and often leading to health complications for patients who don&#8217;t follow their doctors&#8217; orders. A startup called <a href="https://adheretech.com/" target="_blank">AdhereTech</a> came up with an idea to remedy that problem: a wireless pill bottle that would alert patients when they have to take their meds and keep track of their usage and dosage.</p><p>Our product design firm, <a href="http://intelligentproduct.solutions/" target="_blank">IPS</a>, was approached by Adhere Tech to help design and develop a second-generation "smart" pill bottle that would remind patients to take their medication. The AdhereTech IoT pill bottle, now successfully being used by thousands of patients, presented many design challenges. The lessons we learned from this initial undertaking can help guide others with similar projects for connected medical devices.</p><p>We were contracted to provide a full range of design services for the new product from prototype through manufacturing, including mechanical, electrical and industrial design. The company wanted to take a major step forward from its first generation pill bottle to the second generation. The pill bottle needed to see some big changes &#8211; primarily to make it more attractive, user-friendly and manufacturable.</p><p>The company&#8217;s strategic vision for the new pill bottle was to increase adherence and reduce the costs associated with missed or haphazard dosage. We started by designing the product to connect to a cloud service wirelessly, collecting regular usage data and ensuring that patients are taking pills when they are supposed to. The newly designed AdhereTech smart pill bottle is now internet-connected and can alert patients when it&#8217;s time to take their medicine, either through a call or text, or via a blinking light enclosed within the base of the bottle. It also has a wireless CDMA chip that sends a small amount of data, measuring when the bottle was opened and how many pills were taken.</p><p>Our product design expertise &#8722; in particular, our background and experience designing wireless products &#8722; helped us to create the right balance and approach. We viewed the project as essentially a pill bottle with the insides of a cell phone. We were tasked with meeting the fundamental design goals &#8722; to build the product to work globally and be manufactured at scale &#8722; while also tackling the usability design goals to improve the look and feel of the device, greatly extend the battery life and ensure day-to-day durability. Regulatory compliance was of paramount importance.</p><p>Key design challenges for the AdhereTech pill bottle included:</p><p>Battery life: As part of the design process, we worked to create a power-efficient design with more than six months of battery life. This challenge was critical for the new pill bottle and we had to make sure it exceeded the patient&#8217;s prescription duration without requiring battery recharging. The first generation bottles only held a charge of about 45 days, so the pharmacists would have to swap them out for a newly charged bottle every month when the patient picked up refills.</p><p>Ease of use: Since we knew many seniors would be using the new pill bottle, a key design goal for us was ease of use. The challenge was to design a patient-friendly bottle that was actually packed with dense electronics. To make sure it would be simple and worry-free to use, we designed it so that it doesn&#8217;t require the patient to connect to the Internet, plug it in to charge it, or download any software &#8211; all of that is done automatically.</p><p>Regulatory testing and requirements: In addition to the pill bottle product design, we were responsible for facilitating the preliminary regulatory reviews and shepherded the design through FCC regulatory testing. This step is another important part of any IoT product design effort. Regulatory requirements and required certifications must be factored into the design. Because they are connected, IoT products must be tested for radiated emissions and susceptibility. Additionally, cellular carrier testing must be performed.</p><p>In the end, the use of IoT design principles helped the new Adhere Tech pill bottle become a big success. Currently used by many top pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, these innovative smart bottles have been shown to improve medication adherence by an average of 20%.</p><p>The results are helping curb lost sales for pharmaceutical companies, and more importantly, reducing patients&apos; risk of having recurring health problems. AdhereTech&#8217;s solution is making it easy for patients to stay continually on track with their medication.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

If you perhaps have a Fitbit, or any other activity tracker that connects to your phone -- yes, you have. Even if you don&#8217;t have anything like it, you probably will within the next three to five years. The IoT revolution has already started, and as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligence/bi-intelligence-iot-research-bundle-reports-store" target="_blank">BI Intelligence predicts</a>, we will have more than 24 billion IoT devices by the end of the decade.</p><p>What&#8217;s more, the same report also suggests that present-day investments in the IoT will generate around $13 trillion by 2025. And the fact is, people aren&#8217;t making these predictions based on how useful or trendy the current IoT devices are, but rather based on the fact that the IoT has a chance to change business on a fundamental level.</p><p>Let&#8217;s look at some the key ways in which the IoT will affect basically every business sector.</p><h2>Enabling Companies to Create Smarter Devices</h2><p>Not long ago, we didn&#8217;t expect much of our phones -- as a matter of fact, we only expected them to make calls and nothing more.</p><p>However, a vast majority of today&#8217;s customers have much bigger expectations from the little devices they carry around in their pockets. We all now live in a world where you can buy a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/amadoudiallo/2014/08/28/can-babolats-smart-racket-improve-your-tennis-game/" target="_blank">smart racket</a> and even a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-internet-things-can-improve-your-yoga-bernard-marr" target="_blank">smart yoga mat</a>. These things may seem unnecessary at first glance, but these are just the first forays into the expanding universe of the IoT.</p><p>In reality, some of these Internet-capable devices will stick, and a ton of them wont. Nevertheless, companies from all around the world now have the opportunity to develop and manufacture smarter, and in turn, more useful devices. Some companies are already investing huge amounts of money in the IoT. For instance, Europe&#8217;s biggest software company SAP has already invested more than $2.2 billion IoT-capable products.</p><h2>Facilitating Smarter Decisions and Business Operations</h2><p>You have to realize that a huge part of the IoT isn&#8217;t necessarily about the smart devices themselves, but rather about small, data-collecting sensors.</p><p>These tiny devices can be attached to everything from cartons of milk to the cement in large bridges -- more importantly, they are able to send huge quantities of insightful information back to the Cloud. With this data, companies will know how their products are used, when they break down and most importantly what people might want from them in the future.</p><p>Some companies are leveraging these sensors already. For instance, as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2015/06/01/how-big-data-drives-success-at-rolls-royce/&refURL=&referrer=#62fc95213ac0" target="_blank">Forbes reports</a>, new Rolls Royce aircraft engines have sensors that send information on the engine&#8217;s functions back to their researchers in real-time. The researchers are already using all of this data to detect malfunctions and prevent different causes of aircraft disasters.</p><p>In addition, Microsoft is also using software that collects data on what features are mostly being used in their products. This allows them to abandon the least popular ones, and focus on the more popular features.</p><h2>Changes in Business Models</h2><p>Above all this, the IoT will almost definitely mean change of business model for a number of companies.</p><p>Just look at John Deere -- for decades the company has sold standard tractors and equipment. However, since 2012, they have added data connectivity to their products. And as <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3071340/internet-of-things/john-deere-is-plowing-iot-into-its-farm-equipment.html" target="_blank">Network World reports</a>, they are now developing IoT sensors that give farmers key information such as which crops to plant, and when and where to plow. Essentially, they are now selling information as much as they are selling farming equipment.</p><p>Other similar models are slowly starting to emerge -- fitness trackers are already aggregating data about user&#8217;s habits and health stats, and are sharing them with their partners. The fact is, every business has an opportunity to collect enough data to make significant changes to their organizations. Processes like employee management are slowly but surely migrating to the cloud. Which is why, in the next couple of years, tools like <a href="https://www.shiftplanning.com/timeclock" target="_blank">employee time clock software</a> will have a more prominent role in the enterprise.</p><p>If you&#8217;re a business owner, it&apos;s past time to realize that the Internet of Things will certainly impact your business in the next couple of years. But you have to look at the big picture -- it is not just about what kind of products you can make smart, or how all of this information will impact your efficiency.</p><p>The IoT will change everything. Every entrepreneur should already been considering the implications -- if you haven&apos;t, now&apos;s the time to start.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

But a transition to smart lighting is already beginning to occur with the steady penetration of <a href="http://www.ioti.com/smart-home">smart home</a> technology. While 15% of households today have smart home technology in 2017, that number could leap to 61% by 2021, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/279/109/smart-home/united-states#">Statista</a>. In 10 to 15 years, Tanabian says, the conventional light switch could be a rarity. Already, a consumer can order an Amazon Echo Dot for $40 and have similar technology to the voice-enabled light switch he built two decades ago.</p><p>Tanabian sees the transition of the prosaic light switch to an AI-enabled Internet of Things node as an example of where user experience is headed. In 2017, it&apos;s not enough to build great-looking products that are easy to use. A cutting-edge user experience leverages Internet of Things and AI technologies to recede into the background. &#8220;We call it &#8216;invisible UI,&#8217;&#8221; he explains. </p><p>[<strong><em>Hear </em></strong><a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/ux-next/speakers/moe-tanabian"><strong><em>Moe Tanabian</em></strong></a><strong><em> speak on the future of user experience at the UX Next conference in late October.</em></strong>] </p><p>Speaking to a light switch, however, isn&#8217;t what Tanabian means in the context of invisible UI. A simplistic motion-activated light switch isn&#8217;t either. In the future, smart light switches will learn from your behavior to make life easier for you. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say you have the habit of getting up at 3 a.m. and going downstairs and drinking a glass of water and going back upstairs to get back in bed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Along the way, you pass five light switches but only turn up the light level of two of those about halfway.&#8221; Over time, the smart home will learn that pattern and automatically turn on the lights to the level you defined. And if another family member gets up at that time and makes that same journey downstairs, your home won&#8217;t get confused: it will learn to customize the experience based on that family member&#8217;s preferences.</p><p>In years to come, the humble light switch could become a multifunctional node on your smart home&#8217;s IoT network, also capable, for instance, of allowing family members to have phone conversations without picking up a smartphone. If your phone rings and you are in the home office, you could answer it by talking into the microphone and speaker embedded into the light switch. If you get up during the conversation and walk across the house, you could continue the conversation wherever you go, thanks to the <a href="http://www.ioti.com/security/4-ways-secure-your-network-iot-era">network</a> of multifunctional light switches.</p><p>The same invisible-UI principle could work with music as well. With multifunctional light switches installed in your home, if you were playing, say, <em>Yesterday</em> from The Beatles and got up to go downstairs in the middle of the tune, the music would follow you along the way.</p><p>This notion could also transform how we think about thermostats. The problem with smart thermostats, Tanabian says, is that they are designed only to replace existing temperature controls. A thermostat like the Nest may learn from user behavior, but having only one or two thermostats in a household provides a limited number of data points. &#8220;But you can put temperature gauges in the light switches in every room of the house,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And you can personalize the climate in the house to the liking of each person in the household. And if there is no one in the room, the vent shuts. There is no waste of energy.&#8221;</p><p>While such scenarios may sound <a href="http://www.ioti.com/iot-strategy/how-predict-future">futuristic</a>, the transition to invisible user interfaces is already happening. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you an example: Netflix,&#8221; he says. The company uses <a href="http://www.ioti.com/analytics/don-t-fear-ai-fear-human-stupidity">artificial intelligence</a> to recommend content based on your preferences and viewing history. &#8220;That is not only a good experience for you as a user, but it also allows Netflix to look at &#8230; demographic data and create custom content based on [user] interests and [the company&#8217;s] business needs,&#8221; Tanabian explains. &#8220;This is an example of where UI is headed in the future. Even though users participate less actively in it, they get more out of it.&#8221;</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

After all, airports themselves are not merely buildings but machines designed to transport airplanes, passengers, luggage and cargo to precise locations as efficiently as possible. But everyone knows that <a href="http://www.ioti.com/iot-strategy/how-airlines-can-reimagine-their-brand-iot-and-mobile/gallery?slide=1">airports can be chaotic</a>, overwhelming places where ordinary events like a gate change or the need to swap out an airplane&#8217;s tire can cause major disruptions. </p><p>Such problems are, of course, not just a headache for passengers&#8212;they come at a high cost to airlines. A 2013 study from the trade group Airlines for America found that each minute of a delay <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/27/chart-of-the-day-airlines-losing-78minute-today.html">costs airlines $78.17</a>. Globally, such delays cost the aviation industry billions of dollars each year, as do costs associated with other inefficiencies such as mishandled baggage.</p><p>Airlines, however, are beginning to leverage smart building technology and data analytics to boost operational efficiencies. &#8220;Let me give you an example,&#8221; said Jim Heesacker, vice president of business development and strategic alliances at Samsung Electronics America while at the Microsoft Inspire event in Washington, D.C. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say an airline is planning on flying into an airport and arriving at gate A2. But there is a weather-related delay, and they have to change to C2.&#8221; The airline would have to figure out how to quickly transfer several workers from one terminal to another. That can be complicated if, for instance, several passengers on that flight need wheelchair accommodations. &#8220;You are not likely going to get the workers pushing wheelchairs to get from terminal A to C very easily,&#8221; Heesacker notes.</p><p>IoT technology, however, makes it possible to do real-time re-routing and redistribution to see if any available workers in terminal C can be reassigned to the new gate. </p><p><a href="http://www.ioti.com/retail/samsung-iot-platform-targets-pop-retail-stores">Samsung</a>, through its <a href="http://www.ioti.com/security/harman-tackles-internet-things-security-issues-head">Harman subsidiary</a>, has hooked up with Microsoft to make scenarios like this a reality. The companies have joined to deploy an asset-tracking and predictive maintenance tool that leverages Samsung sensors in conjunction with the Azure IoT Hub. A Harman predictive analytics platform can help airport staff make decisions on the fly while communicating relevant data to employees via <a href="http://www.ioti.com/personal/when-it-comes-health-wearables-less-more">a wearable device</a> or smartphone.</p><p>&#8220;We started off by focusing on one use case,&#8221; says Christopher Norwood, director of Harman Connected Services. &#8220;We put this vibration sensor attached to <a href="http://www.ioti.com/iot-developer-zone/samsung-wants-you-use-smartphone-inspired-chips-iot">[a Samsung]  ARTIK</a> gateway and connected it to the aerobridge connecting the airplane to the airport,&#8221; he says. When the jet bridge connects to a plane, it sends an alert to the relevant employees. In the case of a gate change, managers can use the data to help locate and move assets to the new gate. </p><p><a href="http://www.ioti.com/news-and-analysis/when-it-wise-ignore-iot-sensor-data">Putting sensors</a> on jet bridges and wheelchairs while connecting workers with wearables is just the beginning, however. &#8220;The beauty of the enterprise IoT technology is how it scales,&#8221; Norwood says. &#8220;We can put sensors almost anywhere and use a single platform to connect the employees to drive efficiency,&#8221; he explains. If a facilities manager wants to put a sensor on a janitorial cart, Harman can accommodate that. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say there was a spill at gate 5 and the facilities manager is worried that someone could get hurt and sue,&#8221; Norwood says. &#8220;By connecting the janitorial equipment and workers, the manager can identify the quickest way to address that problem.&#8221; </p><p>Heesacker has a similar opinion when it comes to the scalability of the technology. &#8220;When you walk into the room and talk to the facilities maintenance folks, we are solving longstanding problems,&#8221; he says. By simply listening to these workers, they can identify problem areas and potential solutions. &#8220;When we hear that they clean restrooms every hour whether it needs it or not, we explain how they can use technology to that same job more efficiently,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;You can, for instance, put sensors outside of the restroom to track how many people go in and out. &#8220;By using technology, a facilities manager can say: &#8216;<a href="http://www.ioti.com/iot-strategy/how-predict-future">We can predict</a> that the airport will be a little slow tonight so we can let three people go home early.&#8221; </p><p>Heesacker and Norwood report that they see the adoption of smart facilities expanding quickly and that the collaboration between Harman, its new parent Samsung and Microsoft makes it easier for them to launch and scale such projects. &#8220;It&#8217;s a framework,&#8221; Norwood explains. &#8220;It can work anywhere that has a focus on asset tracking, equipment tracking and end-to-end endpoints. That extends across multiple different verticals including airports and transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, and facility maintenance.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s another example,&#8221; Heesacker says. &#8220;I recently spoke with a CIO at a large facilities management company, and he said his margin on employees is 3%.&#8221; Even though the company&#8217;s margins are razor-thin now, the CIO thinks that he can tap IoT technology to transform the firm into a disruptive force. &#8220;We see that same pattern across verticals. </p><p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t long ago that we heard a lot of people asking what IoT means. Now, you are seeing a lot more CEOs and CIOs making IoT part of their strategic curriculum,&#8221; Norwood says. </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

Russia denies involvement in the U.S. or Estonia incidents.</p><h3>Credibility Risk</h3><p>While almost a third of votes were cast electronically in Estonia&#8217;s 2015 general elections, Prime Minister Juri Ratas said last week in an interview that &#8220;daily work is needed to improve its security as any breach would undermine the credibility of the entire system.&#8221;</p><p>In 2014, an expert group led by University of Michigan Professor Alex Halderman, recommended the &#8220;immediate withdrawal&#8221; of Estonian internet voting, citing &#8220;major&#8221; security risks. The OSCE urged Estonia to ensure end-to-end verifiability the following year. While some members of the ruling Center Party want e-voting to be discontinued, the ruling coalition plans to cut the period to three days from seven to make paper-based and electronic voting more uniform.</p><p>To cast their ballot, voters need an ID card and must clear two levels of authentication protected by pass codes. The Estonian Information System Authority, which oversees the government&#8217;s cyber security, says the system can&#8217;t be breached, while Martens says versatile authentication and adaptability to different sizes of voter pools mean the new software could be used by other countries.</p><p>Estonia&#8217;s system is very different from that of the U.S., according to Martens. The attacks on America included incursions into voter databases and software systems.</p><p>&#8220;The problems in the U.S. aren&#8217;t about internet voting -- they&#8217;re about voting machines,&#8221; Martens said. &#8220;There are a lot of machines and no one is able to oversee the software that goes into each one. With internet voting, there&#8217;s a single piece of software that can be controlled.&#8221;</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

But there&apos;s one big challenge: how to manage the vast quantities of data that make such feats possible without making the devices too slow or draining the battery in minutes and wrecking the user experience.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. says it has the answer with a chip design for its HoloLens goggles&#8212;an extra AI processor that analyzes what the user sees and hears right there on the device rather than wasting precious microseconds sending the data back to the cloud. The platform can be used for a variety of applications, including monitoring industrial machinery as well as engineering and design. The new processor for the HoloLens, a version of the company&apos;s existing Holographic Processing Unit, was unveiled at an event in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Sunday. The chip is under development and will be included  in the next version of HoloLens; the company didn&apos;t provide a date.</p><p>This is one of the few times Microsoft is playing all roles (except manufacturing) in developing a new processor. The company says this is the first chip of its kind designed for a mobile device. </p><p>Bringing chipmaking in-house is increasingly in vogue as companies conclude that off-the-shelf processors aren&apos;t capable of fully unleashing the potential of AI. Apple is testing iPhone prototypes that include a chip designed to process AI, a person familiar with the work said in May. Google is on the second version of its own AI chips. To persuade people to buy the next generation of gadgets&#8212;phones, VR headsets, even cars&#8212;the experience will have to be lightning fast and seamless.</p><p>"The consumer is going to expect to have almost no lag and to do real-time processing," says Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. "For an autonomous car, you can&apos;t afford the time to send it back to the cloud to make the decisions to avoid the crash, to avoid hitting a person. The amount of data coming out of autonomous vehicles is tremendous you can&apos;t send all of that to the cloud." By 2025, he says, every device people interact with will have AI built in.</p><p>For years, the central processing units built by Intel Corp. and others have provided enough oomph and smarts to power the world&apos;s gadgets and servers. But the rapid development of artificial intelligence has left some traditional chip makers facing real competition for the first time in over a decade. The accelerating abilities of AI owe much to neural networks that mimic the human brain by analyzing patterns and learning from them. The general-purpose chips used in PCs and servers aren&apos;t designed to rapidly process multiple things at once, a requirement for AI software.</p><p>Microsoft has been working on its own chips for a few years now. It built a motion-tracking processor for its Xbox Kinect video-game system. More recently, in an effort to take on Google and Amazon.com Inc. in cloud services, the company used customizable chips known as field programmable gate arrays to unleash its AI prowess on real-world challenges. Microsoft buys the chips from Altera, a subsidiary of Intel, and adapts them for its own purposes using software, an ability that&apos;s unique to that type of chip.</p><p>In a show of strength last year, Microsoft used thousands of these chips at once to translate all of English Wikipedia  into Spanish&#8212;3 billion words across five million articles&#8212;in less than a tenth of a second. Next Microsoft will let its cloud customers use these chips to speed up their own AI tasks&#8212;a service the company will make available sometime next year. Customers could use it to do things like recognize images from huge sets of data or use machine learning algorithms to predict customer purchasing patterns. &#8220;We&#8217;re taking this very seriously," says Doug Burger, a distinguished engineer in Microsoft Research, who works on the company&apos;s chip development strategy for the cloud. &#8220;Our aspiration is to be the No. 1 AI cloud.&#8221;</p><p>Microsoft has plenty of competition. Amazon also uses field programmable gate arrays and plans to use a new state-of-the-art chip design called Volta for AI built by Nvidia Corp.,  which is now the leading maker of graphics processors used to train AI systems. Meanwhile Google has built it&apos;s own AI semiconductors, called Tensor Processing Units, and is already letting customers use them. Creating chips in-house is expensive, but Microsoft says it has no choice because the technology is changing so fast it&#8217;s easy to get left behind. </p><p>Moving this expertise from the cloud down to the device in a person&apos;s hand or on their face is a key priority for Microsoft&apos;s AI-focused CEO Satya Nadella. In a May speech he touted the idea of using AI to track industrial equipment, telling the user things like where to find a jackhammer, how to use it and generating a warning in case of unauthorized use or a chemical spill. The new HoloLens chip will make that and much more possible. Says Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott: &#8220;We really do need custom silicon to help power some of the scenarios and applications that we are building."</p><p><em><strong>Note: This article was edited to include brief context about the HoloLens.</strong></em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

The documents, obtained by Bloomberg, describe some of the tools under consideration, including sensors that track a range of bodily metrics, from hydration and respiration to blood pressure and alcohol levels.</p><p>The plans included the creation of &#8220;killer applications&#8221; that reverse, delay and improve diabetes and hypertension; detect and monitor abnormal heart rhythms; and improve stress management, according to the documents. &#8220;Consumer-grade tracking will evolve to accurate clinical, then medical-grade monitoring,&#8221; the documents said.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the company -- now known as Jawbone Health Hub -- said the documents are no longer an accurate representation of its plans but declined to say how those plans have changed. &#8220;The documents -- if legitimate and not doctored -- are nearly a year old, for a different company with a different business plan and different product line than the company we are currently operating,&#8221; Jawbone said. &#8220;Our new business plans remain confidential.&#8221;</p><p>Moving into medical devices is audacious. After being forced to liquidate the original Jawbone because it couldn&#8217;t compete with bigger companies such as Apple and Samsung Electronics in the nascent wearables market, Rahman now hopes to take on a slew of rivals, from upstarts like Fitbit to giant medical device makers such as Medtronic Plc, which despite having billions in research funds took more than a decade to get a device for diabetics to market.</p><p>Dr. Steven Nissen, who runs the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, gives any startup&#8217;s move into medical devices long odds. &#8220;First startups have to build it, prove that it works, then you have to get regulators to agree that it works, then you have to show that it has medical value,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s not so simple.&#8221;</p><p>The documents show that Jawbone was planning to harvest some of its technology and ideas from Spectros Corp., a Campbell, California-based maker of medical devices that Rahman acquired in 2015. Spectros founder David Benaron is now chief medical officer of Jawbone Health Hub. The two companies created a bracelet based on the T-Stat oximeter, according to one document. The 11-pound machine that measures oxygen in tissues and is sold to hospitals and surgical practices, according to the Spectros website.</p><p>The bracelet can detect a heart attack or failure by alerting the user when tissue isn&#8217;t getting enough blood, according to a video link cited in the document. The device uses white light and need not touch the skin, according to the video.</p><p>The plans included a potential partnership with Microsoft Corp., which has an app that tracks health and fitness data. Earlier this year, the company unveiled HealthVault Insights that, among other things, works with trackers to make sure patients stick to care plans after leaving the hospital. Under a scenario laid out in the investor pitch, Microsoft would have distributed Jawbone devices and wellness software to corporate customers around the globe. Medical data gathered by the gadgets would sync with Microsoft&#8217;s email and calendar products and alert users when to move and what to eat. </p><p>Microsoft didn&#8217;t return several requests for comment.</p><p>Eventually, Jawbone has said it wants to sell clinical-grade health tracking devices. Products outlined in October include blood-pressure monitors for people suffering from hypertension and a wearable device for diabetes patients; weekly reports on their progress would go to families and physicians. Buyers of both devices would also be enrolled in 12-week disease-management courses, according to the documents.</p><p>Stress management is another focus. The documents sketch out plans to measure respiration, galvanic skin response, skin temperature and blood pressure to detect moments of stress throughout the user&#8217;s waking hours. There would be a companion app that would provide exercises to decrease stress. The package would cost users $7 per month per user.</p><p>Building a medical-device company will require significant R&D investment, which in turn will require investors to buy into Rahman&#8217;s latest vision. He persuaded firms like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures to back the original Jawbone. But the liquidation wiped out most of the combined $900 million in equity and convertible debt funding. Moreover, people who have worked with the Jawbone founder say he&#8217;s much better at selling his vision than running a company. Given the challenges ahead, Rahman will need to muster all the salesmanship he can.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')

A 25,000 square foot Integrated Smart Operations Center (iSOC) in White Plains serves as a power central command center of sorts, with workers monitoring assets on GE Predix software on an 81-foot video wall, according to <a href="https://www.ge.com/reports/smart-power-new-center-will-help-new-yorks-nypa-become-worlds-first-digital-utility/" target="_blank">GE</a>. The mix of engineers and former power plant operators who staff the center alert power plants to potential problems, offering support from the point of identification to resolution, but leaving the decision to act to the plant staff.</p><p>In just shy of a month since its official opening, Tartaglia has found that power plants are actually coming to iSOC for help with potential problems &#8211; something he attributes both to the technology itself and the deep, real-world utilities&#8217; expertise of the iSOC staff. He pointed to its director, Rich Gaines, who joined the NYPA decades ago when he was just 18 years old. The fact that plants are asking for information is a key indicator the iSOC approach is working, according to Tartaglia.</p><p>Right now, Predix runs on-premise, but over the next two years, NYPA will build out its entire Predix implementation on the cloud (the provider of which it hasn&#8217;t yet determined) as part of its IoT strategy, according to Tartaglia.</p><p>The technology in place currently is based on GE SmartSignal, monitoring and diagnostic software from GE that enables NYPA to build digital models of individual assets, track and measure performance, and enable predictive analytics to empower use cases like predictive maintenance. </p><p>For instance, over the summer, a temperature on a motor was running higher than the software said it should run at, according to Tartaglia. After reviewing analytics, the team decided to perform a planned outage, during which they discovered a filter failed.

That information, Kadambi told <em>ITPro Today</em>, can be used to help create more accurate measurements to better guide autonomous vehicles with much more precision.</p><p>"The way we drive a car, we see photons that hit our eyes and make decisions based on that information," he said. "A computer is not as smart as a human brain in terms of driving. To compensate for this, we want to build superhuman sensors that can help with driving."</p><p>The researchers envision depth sensors that can capture a piece of a light wave, or photon, and see exactly how far it has traveled &#8211; the so-called "time of flight," he said.</p><p>"That means that for every object in the world, I could tell you exactly how far it is away from the car with extreme precision," said Kadambi. "Right now this is an active topic of work, to be able to tell us how far away objects are. It is clear we need this capability. It is one of those things that are still being refined to get autonomous cars to work safely."</p><p>Kadambi and the rest of the research team is working on a new approach to <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-depth-sensors-could-be-sensitive-enough-self-driving-cars-1222">time-of-flight imaging</a> that increases its depth resolution 1,000-fold, which has promising uses for self-driving cars. At a range of two meters, existing time-of-flight systems have a depth resolution of about a centimeter. While that&apos;s good enough for the assisted-parking and collision-detection systems on today&apos;s cars, much better accuracy is needed for autonomous vehicles, particularly when weather conditions would degrade due to rain, fog, snow and other hazards, said Kadambi. Ramesh Raskar, an associate professor of media arts and sciences and head of the Camera Culture group at MIT, is the thesis adviser for the project.</p><p>A time of flight depth sensor is like a 3D camera which not only forms a picture of an object, but also tells you how far away it is located.</p><p>"We want to be able to tell you exactly where an object is in the world down to micrometer or micron measurements," he said. "The sensors that exist today, one could argue that they are not sensitive enough, which is why we are not yet seeing these cars in widespread use on the road yet."</p><p>So far, the team&apos;s work went has made its way through concept stages, he said. Experiments have been completed and reported, patents have been filed and the researchers are talking to car companies about the research to see if there is interest in including it in future autonomous driving research and designs.</p><p>"Like any research that comes out of a university, it&apos;s going to require development and support from industry partners to really see this through to fruition," said Kadambi. "I certainly think we are on to something."</p><p>Interestingly, doctors at Harvard Medical School also heard of the team&apos;s research and are looking at how it might also be used to see internal structures within the human body to aid in surgeries, according to MIT.</p><p>"I am excited about medical applications of this technique," Rajiv Gupta, director of the Advanced X-ray Imaging Sciences Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said in a statement. "I was so impressed by the potential of this work to transform medical imaging that we took the rare step of recruiting a graduate student directly to the faculty in our department to continue this work."</p><p>Gupta called the research "a significant milestone in development of time-of-flight techniques" because it removes the need for very fast cameras. "The beauty of Achuta and Ramesh&apos;s work is that by creating beats between lights of two different frequencies, they are able to use ordinary cameras to record time of flight."</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'open', '0', '0', '0')
